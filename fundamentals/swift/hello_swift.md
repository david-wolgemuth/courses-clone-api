## Objective-C

**Yes, we still need to learn Objective-C**. Apple's libraries are all written in Objective-C. Most educational resources and Stack Overflow questions are for Objective-C. In fact, most applications in the App Store are written in Objective-C and this will be true for at least a few years. It's true that **Apple introduced Swift to eventually replace Objective-C**. In fact, although most of the libraries (like Foundation) that we use in Swift are actually written in Objective-C, Apple is already making a big push in rewriting a lot of this content in Swift. Knowing how to speak this language will help us better understand our errors, develop a deeper understanding of what developing for Apple used to be like, and also understand why Apple decided to introduce a new language. This course will be primarily focused on Swift because it is the **language of the future**. 

## Why Swift?

If you have written Objective-C before, you will completely understand why. Swift is similar to interpreted languages like Ruby and JavaScript. However, it is a compiled language. It's the best of both worlds. There's no one out there right now that can consider themselves as a master of Swift. This is a great opportunity for new programmers like us to start mastering this language that was designed to power all future Apple programs. Everyone's in the same boat. Moreover, Swift is the language of the future for all applications developed in the Apple ecosystem. This offers a great opportunity to learn a new language with a lot of backing and interest.

## Xcode

**Even if you have installed it before make sure that you have the latest one (Xcode 7)**. Swift is constantly evolving with each new version of Xcode and as Swift developers, we have to be up to date with all of the versions. We need to know Xcode really well. This is what we will be using in writing our code. **Xcode is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment** which basically means that it does a lot to help the developer. Unlike our plain text files written using a simple text editor and then run through the terminal, Xcode provides us with the **integrated tools to write, build, test, and debug our code**.

## Documentation

We have to become **self-sufficient iOS developers**. Every year new features will be added with the introduction of new operating systems and new devices. To keep up, we are going to be **spending a lot of time in Apple's documentation**. Good news is that Apple's documentation is fantastic. We will be directing you to Apple's documentation to serve as a supplement to this course and we believe that **learning how to digest** Apple's documentation is the single most important skill for an iOS developer. Let's get started by reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0).

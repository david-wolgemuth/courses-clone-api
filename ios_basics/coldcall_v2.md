## Assignment: ColdCall v.2

Let's add another feature to our previous application. Whenever we click on the Cold Call button, we will not only get a random name displayed on the topÂ but also a random number from 1 to 5 inclusive in the center of the screen. If the number is 1 or 2, the number should have a red color, if the number is 3 or 4 then the number should have an orange color, and finally, if the number is 5 then the number should have a green color.

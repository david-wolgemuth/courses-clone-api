# iOS Programming

**iOS is a mobile operating system developed by Apple**. This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.

# What We Need to Know

*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.
*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.
*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.
*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.

## Prerequisites

*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language
*   Latest version of Xcode

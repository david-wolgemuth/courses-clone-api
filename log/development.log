Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs?

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground. Before we move on further let's read the Basic Operators overview, Terminology, Assignment Operator, Arithmetic Operators, Compound Assignment Operators in [Basic Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID60)."], ["file_path", "playground"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC]]

Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases. We will go over them more in depth in a later chapter."], ["file_path", "optionals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:07 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground. Before we move on further let's read the Basic Operators overview, Terminology, Assignment Operator, Arithmetic Operators, Compound Assignment Operators in [Basic Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID60)."], ["file_path", "playground"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:50:57 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground. Before we move on further let's read the Basic Operators overview, Terminology, Assignment Operator, Arithmetic Operators, Compound Assignment Operators in [Basic Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID60)."], ["file_path", "playground"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> (). There's a lot to learn with functions.

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:44 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times. Have the Lion growl.**\n\nUploadyour playground below."], ["file_path", "animals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

For example, let's say we are having a party for NBA Legends. We only want to allow players with at least 5 rings. We could write the logic something like this:</div>\n\n```swift\n// Declare a variable called rings that is of the Int Type.\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we have more than one condition we can add an _else if_ statement:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else if rings > 2 {\n    print(\"Decent...but \\(rings) rings aren't enough\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe used two comparison operators here. First, we checked if rings were greater than equal to 5\\. We also checked if rings were greater than 2\\. Here is a list of Swift's comparison operators:\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\n## ![](http://i.imgur.com/WzRERYY.png)\n\n## Equality vs. Identity\n\n**There is a difference between equality and identity**. For example == checks whether the instances on the left and the right are equal. **Two instances can be equal, but they don't need to have the same location in memory**. The last two operators are called identity operators. We will be going over the differences more in depth once we start creating our own Data Types.\n\n## Logical Operators\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pZx0B28.png)\n\nWe can use Logical Operators in our Conditionals as well. Let's say we want to change the criteria for entering our NBA Legends party. Let's say you have to have at least 5 rings AND have the name Kobe to enter the party:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nlet name = \"Kobe\"\nif rings >= 5 && name == \"Kobe\" {\n  print(\"Welcome to the party \\(name), congratulations on your \\(rings) rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can change our criteria and say that you have to have at least 5 rings or have at least 3 All-Star appearances.\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nvar numOfAllStarAppearances = 17\nif rings >= 5 || numOfAllStarAppearances > 3 {\n  print(\"Welcome you are truly a legend\")\n}\n```\n\nOr we can just let in everyone who is not crazy.\n\n```swift\nvar crazy = true\nif !crazy {\n    print(\"Let's party!\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "conditionals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:55:45 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

After all, understanding how to use these components make up the majority of what builds your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.\n\nPlease create a playground and finish these exercises before uploading.\n\n1.  First, create a loop (either for or while) that prints all of the values from 1-255\n2.  Next, create a program that prints all of the values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both\n3.  Now modify that program to print \"Fizz\" when the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" when the number is divisible by 5 as well as \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both! (See Below).\n\nTo check divisibility you can use the module operator like so:\n\n```swift\nvar number = 2\nif number % 2 == 0 {\n    print(\"Number is even\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "swift_fundamentals_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:22 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

After all, understanding how to use these components make up the majority of what builds your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.\n\nPlease create a playground and finish these exercises before uploading.\n\n1.  First, create a loop (either for or while) that prints all of the values from 1-255\n2.  Next, create a program that prints all of the values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both\n3.  Now modify that program to print \"Fizz\" when the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" when the number is divisible by 5 as well as \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both! (See Below).\n\nTo check divisibility you can use the module operator like so:\n\n```swift\nvar number = 2\nif number % 2 == 0 {\n    print(\"Number is even\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "swift_fundamentals_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:56:37 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

After all, understanding how to use these components make up the majority of what builds your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.\n\nPlease create a playground and finish these exercises before uploading.\n\n1.  First, create a loop (either for or while) that prints all of the values from 1-255\n2.  Next, create a program that prints all of the values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both\n3.  Now modify that program to print \"Fizz\" when the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" when the number is divisible by 5 as well as \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both! (See Below).\n\nTo check divisibility you can use the module operator like so:\n\n```swift\nvar number = 2\nif number % 2 == 0 {\n    print(\"Number is even\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "swift_fundamentals_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:13 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:56 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC]]

After all, understanding how to use these components make up the majority of what builds your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.\n\nPlease create a playground and finish these exercises before uploading.\n\n1.  First, create a loop (either for or while) that prints all of the values from 1-255\n2.  Next, create a program that prints all of the values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both\n3.  Now modify that program to print \"Fizz\" when the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" when the number is divisible by 5 as well as \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both! (See Below).\n\nTo check divisibility you can use the module operator like so:\n\n```swift\nvar number = 2\nif number % 2 == 0 {\n    print(\"Number is even\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "swift_fundamentals_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:57:57 UTC]]

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["file_path", "deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["file_path", "dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["file_path", "auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["file_path", "xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["file_path", "ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["file_path", "classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["file_path", "value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

After all, understanding how to use these components make up the majority of what builds your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.\n\nPlease create a playground and finish these exercises before uploading.\n\n1.  First, create a loop (either for or while) that prints all of the values from 1-255\n2.  Next, create a program that prints all of the values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both\n3.  Now modify that program to print \"Fizz\" when the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" when the number is divisible by 5 as well as \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both! (See Below).\n\nTo check divisibility you can use the module operator like so:\n\n```swift\nvar number = 2\nif number % 2 == 0 {\n    print(\"Number is even\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n}\n```"], ["file_path", "swift_fundamentals_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 18:58:30 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times. Have the Lion growl.**\n\nUploadyour playground below."], ["path", "ios/frameworks/animals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

For example, let's say we are having a party for NBA Legends. We only want to allow players with at least 5 rings. We could write the logic something like this:</div>\n\n```swift\n// Declare a variable called rings that is of the Int Type.\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we have more than one condition we can add an _else if_ statement:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else if rings > 2 {\n    print(\"Decent...but \\(rings) rings aren't enough\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe used two comparison operators here. First, we checked if rings were greater than equal to 5\\. We also checked if rings were greater than 2\\. Here is a list of Swift's comparison operators:\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\n## ![](http://i.imgur.com/WzRERYY.png)\n\n## Equality vs. Identity\n\n**There is a difference between equality and identity**. For example == checks whether the instances on the left and the right are equal. **Two instances can be equal, but they don't need to have the same location in memory**. The last two operators are called identity operators. We will be going over the differences more in depth once we start creating our own Data Types.\n\n## Logical Operators\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pZx0B28.png)\n\nWe can use Logical Operators in our Conditionals as well. Let's say we want to change the criteria for entering our NBA Legends party. Let's say you have to have at least 5 rings AND have the name Kobe to enter the party:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nlet name = \"Kobe\"\nif rings >= 5 && name == \"Kobe\" {\n  print(\"Welcome to the party \\(name), congratulations on your \\(rings) rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can change our criteria and say that you have to have at least 5 rings or have at least 3 All-Star appearances.\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nvar numOfAllStarAppearances = 17\nif rings >= 5 || numOfAllStarAppearances > 3 {\n  print(\"Welcome you are truly a legend\")\n}\n```\n\nOr we can just let in everyone who is not crazy.\n\n```swift\nvar crazy = true\nif !crazy {\n    print(\"Let's party!\")\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/conditionals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> (). There's a lot to learn with functions.

Apple's libraries are all written in Objective-C. Most educational resources and Stack Overflow questions are for Objective-C. In fact, most applications in the App Store are written in Objective-C and this will be true for at least a few years. It's true that **Apple introduced Swift to eventually replace Objective-C**. In fact, although most of the libraries (like Foundation) that we use in Swift are actually written in Objective-C, Apple is already making a big push in rewriting a lot of this content in Swift. Knowing how to speak this language will help us better understand our errors, develop a deeper understanding of what developing for Apple used to be like, and also understand why Apple decided to introduce a new language. This course will be primarily focused on Swift because it is the **language of the future**. \n\n## Why Swift?\n\nIf you have written Objective-C before, you will completely understand why. Swift is similar to interpreted languages like Ruby and JavaScript. However, it is a compiled language. It's the best of both worlds. There's no one out there right now that can consider themselves as a master of Swift. This is a great opportunity for new programmers like us to start mastering this language that was designed to power all future Apple programs. Everyone's in the same boat. Moreover, Swift is the language of the future for all applications developed in the Apple ecosystem. This offers a great opportunity to learn a new language with a lot of backing and interest.\n\n## Xcode\n\n**Even if you have installed it before make sure that you have the latest one (Xcode 7)**. Swift is constantly evolving with each new version of Xcode and as Swift developers, we have to be up to date with all of the versions. We need to know Xcode really well. This is what we will be using in writing our code. **Xcode is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment** which basically means that it does a lot to help the developer. Unlike our plain text files written using a simple text editor and then run through the terminal, Xcode provides us with the **integrated tools to write, build, test, and debug our code**.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe have to become **self-sufficient iOS developers**. Every year new features will be added with the introduction of new operating systems and new devices. To keep up, we are going to be **spending a lot of time in Apple's documentation**. Good news is that Apple's documentation is fantastic. We will be directing you to Apple's documentation to serve as a supplement to this course and we believe that **learning how to digest** Apple's documentation is the single most important skill for an iOS developer. Let's get started by reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/hello_swift_file_renamed"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

We discussed how **Structs are passed by value** and **Classes are passed by reference**. The second main difference is that **Classes support inheritance** while **Structs do not**. In our Classes example, we created a Person class. Now let's create a Developer class that **inherits** from the Person class.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {         // Note: this function doesn't get called explicitly.  It is called \n                               // when creating an instance using the initialization syntax -- \"Person()\"\n    self.name = name           // Note the use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\") \n                               // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nclass Developer: Person {      // Note how we are specifying that Developer will inherit from Person\n  var favoriteLanguage: String\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage\n    super.init(name: name)\n  }\n  override func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n}\nvar myDeveloper: Developer = Developer(name: \"Jay\", favoriteLanguage: \"Swift\")\nmyDeveloper.speak()\n```\n\nWow, that's a lot of new code! Let's go over it in sections.\n\n### Subclassing\n\nSubclassing refers to creating a new class that is based on another class. This allows our new class to inherit all of the characteristics of the parent class. In our example above we specify that Developer is a subclass of Person in the class definition itself.\n\n```swift\nclass Developer: Person {         // Here we specify that Person is the \"Superclass\"\n  // Developer definition here\n}\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\nWhen we create a subclass, it automatically gains access to the super's init method. But what if we want to add logic to the initialization of just the subclass? In our Developer example, we want to also specify a favoriteLanguage property in the subclass' initialization. We do not want the Person class to have a favoriteLanguage so we declare the property in the Developer class and create another init method.\n\n```swift\n  var favoriteLanguage: String       // Declaring the favoriteLanguage property in Developer means that\n                                     // it is only available in Developer and Developer's subclasses.\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {           // Developer's init method takes in\n                                                           // a name and a favoriteLanguage.\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage               // We set the favoriteLanguage property.\n                                     // We then call the superclass' init method and pass it the name\n    super.init(name: name)           // property since the logic is already written in Person's init.\n  }\n```\n\nThe main thing to remember when creating an init method in a subclass is the use of\n\n<pre> super.init\n```\n\nwhich allows us to call upon the superclass' initialization method.\n\n### Overriding Superclass Methods\n\nBy default, a subclass has access to all of the superclass' methods and properties. However, what if we wanted to override a particular method's functionality. Fortunately Swift allows us to prefix a method name with the override keyword to specify that we will be overriding the default superclass functionality. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n  override func speak() {                    // We specify that we are overriding the speak function.\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n```\n\nNow when we called speak on an instance of Developer it will run the Developer's speak function rather than the superclass speak function."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/inheritance"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Swift is what we call a **statically typed language** what this means is that we need to specifically declare the \"type\" of each of our variables. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n// Variables are used to store data. We declare a variable using the \"var\" keyword.\n// We also have to specify the type of that variable.\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\n// Every variable declaration follows the same format:\n// var variable_name: variable_type = variable_value\n```\n\nAlthough this may seem unnecessary, strongly typed languages allow the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough memory to store the specific data type. Internally, computers store variables in blocks of memory that are just 1s and 0s. Specifying the type allows the computer to understand not only how much actual space to allocate but also how to interpret the 1s and 0s that are stored!\n\nA strongly typed language not only forces you to **declare the type** but, more importantly, disallows you from **changing the type** this means that once a variable is declared as a \"String\" type it must always store a String. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\nname = \"Darth Vader\"  // Changing the \"name\" variable to another string is allowed...\n                      // ...but trying to change the var to a value of ANOTHER type is not allowed.\nname = 42             // THIS WON'T WORK because we are trying to change a variable that is a \"String\"\n                      // type to a value that is a \"Int\" type\n```\n\n**This means that once we declare a variable we can only hold one specific type of data inside of it!**\n\n### Basic Types\n\n```swift\nvar str: String = \"This is a String\"   // \"String\" type.\nvar num: Int = -42                     // \"Int\" type stores whole numbers both negative and positive.\nvar dec: Double = 4.2                  // \"Double\" type stores numbers with decimals (allocates 64 bits).\n```\n\n### Why is Swift Statically Typed?\n\n**Performance**.\n\nMany other languages like Ruby and Javascript are **dynamically typed languages** meaning that we don't need to specifically declare the type and we can change what is stored in a variable back and forth between different types. Although loosely typed languages may be easier for the developer (since the developer doesn't need to worry about types), it reduces performance because now the computer has to worry about remembering types and how to store different values of different types. In addition, the computer now has to allocate extra space for each variable and it has to store them in such a way that the variable can hold any type of information. **Swift is statically typed** so it forces the developer to be more conscious about types and it also allows the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough space for each variable.\n\n# Type Inference\n\nConstantly having to specify the type can get tedious very quickly. Fortunately in addition to caring about performance, Swift also caters to the developer! Swift uses \"type inference\" to allow us to forego specifying the type when declaring a variable and assigning it to a value in the same line. Swift will look at the value and \"infer\" the type so that you don't have to specify it.\n\n```swift\n// Swift has \"type inference\"\nvar name = \"Anakin\"  // String type\n                     // Swift looked at val on the right and inferred type: we didn't have to specify!\n```\n\n#### Even though we didn't have to specify the type, the variable still has a type that cannot change after a declaration.\n\n```swift\nvar name = \"Anakin\"            // Type inferred as String based on the value \"Anakin\"\nname = 42                      // THIS IS STILL NOT ALLOWED since name is a \"String\" type\n```\n\n**Take a minute and try out the above code in a playground and see what the error message is.**\n\n# Constants\n\n**Variables hold data that varies**. In many programming languages, variables are used for everything, even for values that never change. **Constants hold data that does not vary**. We cannot change constants. Constants are a big deal in Swift. **Use constants in all parts of your code except for areas where you HAVE to use a variable**. Using constants to hold data that won't change allows our code to be more explicit while at the same time helps the compiler to run our programs more effectively. \n\nWe declare constants using the \"let\" keyword:\n\n```swift\n                            // Declare name as a constant because we anticipate that it will NOT change.\nlet name: String = \"Anakin Skywalker\"\n                            // Note that just like variables, constants also have types\n                            // Now we cannot change the name:\nname = \"Darth Vader\"        // THIS WON'T WORK because name is a constant so we CANNOT change it.\n```\n\n## Mutable vs. Immutable\n\n**Mutable** means that we can change the value and** immutable** means that we cannot change the value. In Objective-C, there were _explicit Types_ that were indicated as Immutable. For example, there was a class for mutable_ String Types_ and a separate class for immutable _String Types_. In Swift, we can still have immutable and mutable Strings without having another class because of the difference between the_ let _and the _var_ keywords.\n\nWe use the keyword_ let _when we want to declare a constant. **Constants** are values that are not going to change during your program. We use the_ var _keyword when we want to hold onto a value that might change. Using these keywords we can create mutable strings and immutable strings.\n\n```swift\n                                // We are declaring a mutable string because we store it in a var.\nvar myMutableString = \"change me\"\n                                // We are declaring an immutable string because we store it in a const.\nlet myImmutableString = \"can't change\"\n                                // We can change the value of a mutable string...\nmyMutableString += \"!\"\n                                // ...but we cannot change the value of an immutable string.\nmyImmutableString += \"ahhhh\"    // This will error.\n```\n\nThis is the same for Arrays.\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a mutable array because we are storing it in a variable.\nvar myMutableArray = [\"one\"]\n// We are declaring an immutable array because we are storing it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableArray = [\"uno\"]\n// We can append new String instances to the mutable array...\nmyMutableArray.append(\"two\")\n// ... in fact we can add new things to this mutable array as well...\nmyMutableArray + [\"three\", \"four\"]\n// ...but we will get an error when we try to do the same to an immutable array.\nmyImmutableArray.append(\"dos\")\n```\n\nAnd for dictionaries.\n\n```swift\n                          // We are declaring a mutable dictionary because we store it in a variable.\nvar myMutableDictionary = [\"one\": 1]\n                          // We are declaring an immutable dictionary because we store it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableDictionary = [\"uno\": 1]\n                          // We can add a new key-value pair to our mutable dictionary ...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"two\"] = 2\n                          // ... or update a value of an existing key...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"one\"] = 0\n                          // ... but we get an error when we try to do same to an immutable dictionary.\nmyImmutableDictionary[\"uno\"] = 2\n```"], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/let_and_var"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

If we want to execute a set of code repeatedly for a given number of iterations or until it reaches a specific condition, we will use loops. There are two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. We **use the for loop when we know beforehand how many times we are going to have to repeat the code** while we **use the while loop when we don't know how many times we have to run the code, but we know we have to run the code until it reaches a particular condition.** However, at their core, they are both the same, we can do whatever you can do with a for loop instead of a while loop and vice versa.\n\n## For-in Loops\n\nA **for-in loop performs a set of code in a specific range, sequence, or collection**. For now, we will focus on using the for-in loop with a range. Go ahead and run the following code below, in the playground, and see what the output is from the Assistant Editor.\n\n```swift\n// loop from 1 to 5 including 5\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from 1 to 5 excluding 5\nfor i in 1..<5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nYou can just as easily use variables to create a range as well!\n\n```swift\nvar start = 0\nvar end = 5\n// loop from start to end including end\nfor i in start...end {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from start to end excluding end\nfor i in start..<end {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nNote that when writing for loops in Swift, you will always use the \"for-in\" style with a range. Although you can still use the C-style for loops with the separate initialization, condition, and increment clauses it has been deprecated in Swift 2.x and will be taken out altogether in Swift 3.\n\n## While Loops\n\nA **while loop is used to loop for an unknown number of times.** Unlike a For-in loop where you first specify a range to loop through, in a while loop, we simply specify a condition. Anything that we write with a for-in loop can be written with a while loop. Let's see how we can convert our for-in loops to while loops.\n\nWe can re-write this _**for-in**_ loop...\n\n```swift\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\n... as a **_while_** loop.\n\n```swift\nvar i = 1\nwhile i < 6 {\n    print(i)\n    i = i+1\n}\n```\n\nNote that the while loop syntax requires us to create our own bounds. In later assignments, you may find situations where you don't know how many times you will need to repeat before entering the loop in these situations it is important to know how to use a while loop."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/loops"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

There is a minimum and maximum value that an instance of an _Int Type_ can represent. _Int Type_ is signed in Swift. What this means is that **it uses some of its possible representations to store negative numbers**. Let's see what the maximum value and minimum value of the Int Type is in Swift:\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int.min)\")\n```\n\nOn OS X (the desktop operating system) allocates 64 bits to store an _Int Type_. On iOS, this is different because some devices store _Int Types_ in 64 bits while older models such as the iPhone 5 utilize the 32-bit infrastructure. This seems like a big headache. Does that mean we have to write different code for different devices? **If we use the instances of the Int Type, the compiler will determine the appropriate size for an Int when it builds your program.**\n\n## Int32\n\nWe can have an Int be stored in 32 bits by creating an instance of _Int32 Type_. It is important to note that _Int_ and _Int32_ are different Types. _Int32_ is also signed. Let's see what the maximum and the minimum value of _Int32_ are.\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int32.min)\")\n```\n\nThere's also similar Types available such as _Int8, Int16,_ and _Int64_. We only use these specific integer types when we are doing something like cryptography where the way integers are stored is important. We will also run across these types when we are interacting with libraries built when storing 32 bits for an integer was very common. **Most of the time you will simply use the _Int_ type**\n\n## UInt32\n\nWe also have the unsigned integer counterparts as well. Once again we should only be using these specific Integer type when the nature of our program forces us to. **We should use Int for all other cases and let the compiler decide how much memory to allocate when storing integers.**\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(UInt32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(UInt32.min)\")\n```\n\n## Swift is Strongly Typed\n\n_Int, Int32, UInt32_ and all of the other variations of storing integers are all different types. What this means is that if we declare a constant or a variable to be of a specific Type, we can't assign a different type to it, even though they are just numbers.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k6zEyyo.png)\n\n**We want to use Int consistently throughout our code** so that we can leave the hard work to the compiler. We can convert other variations of the _Int Type_ by using this syntax:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt32: Int32 = 3\nvar myNormalInt: Int\n                     // This will not error, because we first convert Int32 to instance of Int Type\nmyNormalInt = Int(myInt32)\n```\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\n\n**There is a finite number of bits a computer has to represent: an infinite amount of numbers**. So how would a computer represent something like 1/3 which is .3333333 with 3's repeating until forever? A computer will try to do its best. The most important concept in this tab is the **while _Int's_ are precise, Floating Point Types are not**.\n\n## Double vs. Float\n\nSwift has two Types to represent numbers with decimals. The first is the **Double Type** which allocates 64 bits to represent a floating point number and the second is the **Float Type** which allocates 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Since a _Double Type_ **has more representations available** to it, it will **store the floating point number more precisely**. Rather than the _Int Type_ where the bits represented how many_ Int's_ it can represent, the extra bits for floating point numbers just represent its precision.\n\n## Double Is the Inferred Type\n\nIf we store a floating point number to a variable or a constant **Swift will automatically assume that it is a Double**. Just like how we want to use _Int's_ in our code as much as possible, we want to **use Doubles as much as possible so we can rely on Swift's type inference.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i0VTX7X.png) \n\n## Operations\n\nWe can perform basic operations in Swift such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\n```swift\nprint(\"Addition \\(1 + 3)\")\nprint(\"Subtraction \\(1 - 3)\")\nprint(\"Multiplication \\(1 * 3)\")\nprint(\"Division \\(1 / 3)\")\n```\n\nWhen we divide an instance of the _Int Type_ with another instance of the _Int Type_, we get another new instance of the _Int Type_. Then what will happen if we divide 1 with 3? We would expect the result to be something like .33333333.  **It results in zero because remember that Int's can only be whole numbers.** If there are decimal points then there is a different _Data Type_ for that. If we divide two _Int's_ together and its result should be represented in a decimal, Swift will just round the number down(even if it's 8.9999)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/numerical_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break.

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["path", "ios/intro_to_osx/value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["path", "ios/ios_advanced/ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

You can think of stacks as similar to divs in HTML that act as containers. We will be remaking the previous assignment of TicTacToe with stack views. Using Stack Views make building interfaces much easier in iOS so let's get started with them!\n\n**_**Keep in mind stack views are not a complete replacement for auto-layout, but rather an additional tool to make the auto-layout process easier**_**\n\n## Step 1:\n\nSimilar to HTML/CSS divs layouts we want to start by laying out the major areas of our app that will be contained in stacks first then proceed to add elements inside of them. Start by adding 4 major vertical stack sections for the top label, middle section to hold our gameboard buttons and two more for our hidden winner label and the reset button.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5898_1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nFrom here we want to add some basic constraints to these 4 stacks. For all of the stack views, we want to add leading, trailing, top, and bottom constraints. We also want to be sure to add height values to **ALL** **BUT** the middle stack. The middle stack does not get a set height constraint due to it being the one that we want to have dynamically changed as the size of the screen and orientation shift.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nWe can add text and buttons to the other stacks on the page as needed now. You will notice that these elements will auto size to the size of the stack they are placed in. The text for the buttons will be centered automatically, but for text in labels to be centered you just need to change the text alignment.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5899_2.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nOnce this is done we want to change the distribution of our middle stack that will hold our gameboard buttons to \"Fill Equally\" so that anything added to it will take up equal percentages of the stack they are contained in. If the distribution is left to \"Fill\" all elements will full size to the container, overlapping each other instead of trying to share the container space.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5900_3.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nThe next thing to do is to add three horizontal stacks that will be inside this middle vertical stack. This is done to represent the rows for the buttons. This system of embedding horizontal stacks in a vertical one or vice versa makes for an easy way of defining a grid system. **Remember these newly added stacks will be needed to be set to a Fill Equally distribution as well just like their parent.**\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5901_4.png)\n\n## Step 6:\n\nWe can now add our buttons to each row simply by dragging them into their respective rows (the horizontal stacks). Easy enough! With that, you can add some styling and background effects to the buttons as desired.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5902_5.png)\n\n**With that, we have fully laid out our TicTacToe App that will work for any orientation.** The only additional thing is currently the buttons are completely touching so if we wanted to add something similar to the padding or margin properties typically found in CSS to the stack we just have to edit the \"spacing\" of these stacks. This can be done by clicking each stack and changing its spacing property found on the right-side editor.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5903_6.png)"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/stack_views"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting. To fix this, we have to add constraints with Auto Layout.**"], ["path", "ios/ios_intern/ui_first"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:15:33 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times. Have the Lion growl.**\n\nUploadyour playground below."], ["path", "ios/frameworks/animals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

For example, let's say we are having a party for NBA Legends. We only want to allow players with at least 5 rings. We could write the logic something like this:</div>\n\n```swift\n// Declare a variable called rings that is of the Int Type.\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we have more than one condition we can add an _else if_ statement:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else if rings > 2 {\n    print(\"Decent...but \\(rings) rings aren't enough\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe used two comparison operators here. First, we checked if rings were greater than equal to 5\\. We also checked if rings were greater than 2\\. Here is a list of Swift's comparison operators:\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\n## ![](http://i.imgur.com/WzRERYY.png)\n\n## Equality vs. Identity\n\n**There is a difference between equality and identity**. For example == checks whether the instances on the left and the right are equal. **Two instances can be equal, but they don't need to have the same location in memory**. The last two operators are called identity operators. We will be going over the differences more in depth once we start creating our own Data Types.\n\n## Logical Operators\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pZx0B28.png)\n\nWe can use Logical Operators in our Conditionals as well. Let's say we want to change the criteria for entering our NBA Legends party. Let's say you have to have at least 5 rings AND have the name Kobe to enter the party:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nlet name = \"Kobe\"\nif rings >= 5 && name == \"Kobe\" {\n  print(\"Welcome to the party \\(name), congratulations on your \\(rings) rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can change our criteria and say that you have to have at least 5 rings or have at least 3 All-Star appearances.\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nvar numOfAllStarAppearances = 17\nif rings >= 5 || numOfAllStarAppearances > 3 {\n  print(\"Welcome you are truly a legend\")\n}\n```\n\nOr we can just let in everyone who is not crazy.\n\n```swift\nvar crazy = true\nif !crazy {\n    print(\"Let's party!\")\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/conditionals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.  Give the Card a property \"Suit\" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n3.  Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Apple's libraries are all written in Objective-C. Most educational resources and Stack Overflow questions are for Objective-C. In fact, most applications in the App Store are written in Objective-C and this will be true for at least a few years. It's true that **Apple introduced Swift to eventually replace Objective-C**. In fact, although most of the libraries (like Foundation) that we use in Swift are actually written in Objective-C, Apple is already making a big push in rewriting a lot of this content in Swift. Knowing how to speak this language will help us better understand our errors, develop a deeper understanding of what developing for Apple used to be like, and also understand why Apple decided to introduce a new language. This course will be primarily focused on Swift because it is the **language of the future**. \n\n## Why Swift?\n\nIf you have written Objective-C before, you will completely understand why. Swift is similar to interpreted languages like Ruby and JavaScript. However, it is a compiled language. It's the best of both worlds. There's no one out there right now that can consider themselves as a master of Swift. This is a great opportunity for new programmers like us to start mastering this language that was designed to power all future Apple programs. Everyone's in the same boat. Moreover, Swift is the language of the future for all applications developed in the Apple ecosystem. This offers a great opportunity to learn a new language with a lot of backing and interest.\n\n## Xcode\n\n**Even if you have installed it before make sure that you have the latest one (Xcode 7)**. Swift is constantly evolving with each new version of Xcode and as Swift developers, we have to be up to date with all of the versions. We need to know Xcode really well. This is what we will be using in writing our code. **Xcode is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment** which basically means that it does a lot to help the developer. Unlike our plain text files written using a simple text editor and then run through the terminal, Xcode provides us with the **integrated tools to write, build, test, and debug our code**.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe have to become **self-sufficient iOS developers**. Every year new features will be added with the introduction of new operating systems and new devices. To keep up, we are going to be **spending a lot of time in Apple's documentation**. Good news is that Apple's documentation is fantastic. We will be directing you to Apple's documentation to serve as a supplement to this course and we believe that **learning how to digest** Apple's documentation is the single most important skill for an iOS developer. Let's get started by reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/hello_swift_file_renamed"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

We discussed how **Structs are passed by value** and **Classes are passed by reference**. The second main difference is that **Classes support inheritance** while **Structs do not**. In our Classes example, we created a Person class. Now let's create a Developer class that **inherits** from the Person class.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {         // Note: this function doesn't get called explicitly.  It is called \n                               // when creating an instance using the initialization syntax -- \"Person()\"\n    self.name = name           // Note the use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\") \n                               // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nclass Developer: Person {      // Note how we are specifying that Developer will inherit from Person\n  var favoriteLanguage: String\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage\n    super.init(name: name)\n  }\n  override func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n}\nvar myDeveloper: Developer = Developer(name: \"Jay\", favoriteLanguage: \"Swift\")\nmyDeveloper.speak()\n```\n\nWow, that's a lot of new code! Let's go over it in sections.\n\n### Subclassing\n\nSubclassing refers to creating a new class that is based on another class. This allows our new class to inherit all of the characteristics of the parent class. In our example above we specify that Developer is a subclass of Person in the class definition itself.\n\n```swift\nclass Developer: Person {         // Here we specify that Person is the \"Superclass\"\n  // Developer definition here\n}\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\nWhen we create a subclass, it automatically gains access to the super's init method. But what if we want to add logic to the initialization of just the subclass? In our Developer example, we want to also specify a favoriteLanguage property in the subclass' initialization. We do not want the Person class to have a favoriteLanguage so we declare the property in the Developer class and create another init method.\n\n```swift\n  var favoriteLanguage: String       // Declaring the favoriteLanguage property in Developer means that\n                                     // it is only available in Developer and Developer's subclasses.\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {           // Developer's init method takes in\n                                                           // a name and a favoriteLanguage.\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage               // We set the favoriteLanguage property.\n                                     // We then call the superclass' init method and pass it the name\n    super.init(name: name)           // property since the logic is already written in Person's init.\n  }\n```\n\nThe main thing to remember when creating an init method in a subclass is the use of\n\n<pre> super.init\n```\n\nwhich allows us to call upon the superclass' initialization method.\n\n### Overriding Superclass Methods\n\nBy default, a subclass has access to all of the superclass' methods and properties. However, what if we wanted to override a particular method's functionality. Fortunately Swift allows us to prefix a method name with the override keyword to specify that we will be overriding the default superclass functionality. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n  override func speak() {                    // We specify that we are overriding the speak function.\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n```\n\nNow when we called speak on an instance of Developer it will run the Developer's speak function rather than the superclass speak function."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/inheritance"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

Swift is what we call a **statically typed language** what this means is that we need to specifically declare the \"type\" of each of our variables. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n// Variables are used to store data. We declare a variable using the \"var\" keyword.\n// We also have to specify the type of that variable.\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\n// Every variable declaration follows the same format:\n// var variable_name: variable_type = variable_value\n```\n\nAlthough this may seem unnecessary, strongly typed languages allow the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough memory to store the specific data type. Internally, computers store variables in blocks of memory that are just 1s and 0s. Specifying the type allows the computer to understand not only how much actual space to allocate but also how to interpret the 1s and 0s that are stored!\n\nA strongly typed language not only forces you to **declare the type** but, more importantly, disallows you from **changing the type** this means that once a variable is declared as a \"String\" type it must always store a String. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\nname = \"Darth Vader\"  // Changing the \"name\" variable to another string is allowed...\n                      // ...but trying to change the var to a value of ANOTHER type is not allowed.\nname = 42             // THIS WON'T WORK because we are trying to change a variable that is a \"String\"\n                      // type to a value that is a \"Int\" type\n```\n\n**This means that once we declare a variable we can only hold one specific type of data inside of it!**\n\n### Basic Types\n\n```swift\nvar str: String = \"This is a String\"   // \"String\" type.\nvar num: Int = -42                     // \"Int\" type stores whole numbers both negative and positive.\nvar dec: Double = 4.2                  // \"Double\" type stores numbers with decimals (allocates 64 bits).\n```\n\n### Why is Swift Statically Typed?\n\n**Performance**.\n\nMany other languages like Ruby and Javascript are **dynamically typed languages** meaning that we don't need to specifically declare the type and we can change what is stored in a variable back and forth between different types. Although loosely typed languages may be easier for the developer (since the developer doesn't need to worry about types), it reduces performance because now the computer has to worry about remembering types and how to store different values of different types. In addition, the computer now has to allocate extra space for each variable and it has to store them in such a way that the variable can hold any type of information. **Swift is statically typed** so it forces the developer to be more conscious about types and it also allows the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough space for each variable.\n\n# Type Inference\n\nConstantly having to specify the type can get tedious very quickly. Fortunately in addition to caring about performance, Swift also caters to the developer! Swift uses \"type inference\" to allow us to forego specifying the type when declaring a variable and assigning it to a value in the same line. Swift will look at the value and \"infer\" the type so that you don't have to specify it.\n\n```swift\n// Swift has \"type inference\"\nvar name = \"Anakin\"  // String type\n                     // Swift looked at val on the right and inferred type: we didn't have to specify!\n```\n\n#### Even though we didn't have to specify the type, the variable still has a type that cannot change after a declaration.\n\n```swift\nvar name = \"Anakin\"            // Type inferred as String based on the value \"Anakin\"\nname = 42                      // THIS IS STILL NOT ALLOWED since name is a \"String\" type\n```\n\n**Take a minute and try out the above code in a playground and see what the error message is.**\n\n# Constants\n\n**Variables hold data that varies**. In many programming languages, variables are used for everything, even for values that never change. **Constants hold data that does not vary**. We cannot change constants. Constants are a big deal in Swift. **Use constants in all parts of your code except for areas where you HAVE to use a variable**. Using constants to hold data that won't change allows our code to be more explicit while at the same time helps the compiler to run our programs more effectively. \n\nWe declare constants using the \"let\" keyword:\n\n```swift\n                            // Declare name as a constant because we anticipate that it will NOT change.\nlet name: String = \"Anakin Skywalker\"\n                            // Note that just like variables, constants also have types\n                            // Now we cannot change the name:\nname = \"Darth Vader\"        // THIS WON'T WORK because name is a constant so we CANNOT change it.\n```\n\n## Mutable vs. Immutable\n\n**Mutable** means that we can change the value and** immutable** means that we cannot change the value. In Objective-C, there were _explicit Types_ that were indicated as Immutable. For example, there was a class for mutable_ String Types_ and a separate class for immutable _String Types_. In Swift, we can still have immutable and mutable Strings without having another class because of the difference between the_ let _and the _var_ keywords.\n\nWe use the keyword_ let _when we want to declare a constant. **Constants** are values that are not going to change during your program. We use the_ var _keyword when we want to hold onto a value that might change. Using these keywords we can create mutable strings and immutable strings.\n\n```swift\n                                // We are declaring a mutable string because we store it in a var.\nvar myMutableString = \"change me\"\n                                // We are declaring an immutable string because we store it in a const.\nlet myImmutableString = \"can't change\"\n                                // We can change the value of a mutable string...\nmyMutableString += \"!\"\n                                // ...but we cannot change the value of an immutable string.\nmyImmutableString += \"ahhhh\"    // This will error.\n```\n\nThis is the same for Arrays.\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a mutable array because we are storing it in a variable.\nvar myMutableArray = [\"one\"]\n// We are declaring an immutable array because we are storing it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableArray = [\"uno\"]\n// We can append new String instances to the mutable array...\nmyMutableArray.append(\"two\")\n// ... in fact we can add new things to this mutable array as well...\nmyMutableArray + [\"three\", \"four\"]\n// ...but we will get an error when we try to do the same to an immutable array.\nmyImmutableArray.append(\"dos\")\n```\n\nAnd for dictionaries.\n\n```swift\n                          // We are declaring a mutable dictionary because we store it in a variable.\nvar myMutableDictionary = [\"one\": 1]\n                          // We are declaring an immutable dictionary because we store it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableDictionary = [\"uno\": 1]\n                          // We can add a new key-value pair to our mutable dictionary ...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"two\"] = 2\n                          // ... or update a value of an existing key...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"one\"] = 0\n                          // ... but we get an error when we try to do same to an immutable dictionary.\nmyImmutableDictionary[\"uno\"] = 2\n```"], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/let_and_var"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

If we want to execute a set of code repeatedly for a given number of iterations or until it reaches a specific condition, we will use loops. There are two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. We **use the for loop when we know beforehand how many times we are going to have to repeat the code** while we **use the while loop when we don't know how many times we have to run the code, but we know we have to run the code until it reaches a particular condition.** However, at their core, they are both the same, we can do whatever you can do with a for loop instead of a while loop and vice versa.\n\n## For-in Loops\n\nA **for-in loop performs a set of code in a specific range, sequence, or collection**. For now, we will focus on using the for-in loop with a range. Go ahead and run the following code below, in the playground, and see what the output is from the Assistant Editor.\n\n```swift\n// loop from 1 to 5 including 5\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from 1 to 5 excluding 5\nfor i in 1..<5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nYou can just as easily use variables to create a range as well!\n\n```swift\nvar start = 0\nvar end = 5\n// loop from start to end including end\nfor i in start...end {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from start to end excluding end\nfor i in start..<end {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nNote that when writing for loops in Swift, you will always use the \"for-in\" style with a range. Although you can still use the C-style for loops with the separate initialization, condition, and increment clauses it has been deprecated in Swift 2.x and will be taken out altogether in Swift 3.\n\n## While Loops\n\nA **while loop is used to loop for an unknown number of times.** Unlike a For-in loop where you first specify a range to loop through, in a while loop, we simply specify a condition. Anything that we write with a for-in loop can be written with a while loop. Let's see how we can convert our for-in loops to while loops.\n\nWe can re-write this _**for-in**_ loop...\n\n```swift\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\n... as a **_while_** loop.\n\n```swift\nvar i = 1\nwhile i < 6 {\n    print(i)\n    i = i+1\n}\n```\n\nNote that the while loop syntax requires us to create our own bounds. In later assignments, you may find situations where you don't know how many times you will need to repeat before entering the loop in these situations it is important to know how to use a while loop."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/loops"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

There is a minimum and maximum value that an instance of an _Int Type_ can represent. _Int Type_ is signed in Swift. What this means is that **it uses some of its possible representations to store negative numbers**. Let's see what the maximum value and minimum value of the Int Type is in Swift:\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int.min)\")\n```\n\nOn OS X (the desktop operating system) allocates 64 bits to store an _Int Type_. On iOS, this is different because some devices store _Int Types_ in 64 bits while older models such as the iPhone 5 utilize the 32-bit infrastructure. This seems like a big headache. Does that mean we have to write different code for different devices? **If we use the instances of the Int Type, the compiler will determine the appropriate size for an Int when it builds your program.**\n\n## Int32\n\nWe can have an Int be stored in 32 bits by creating an instance of _Int32 Type_. It is important to note that _Int_ and _Int32_ are different Types. _Int32_ is also signed. Let's see what the maximum and the minimum value of _Int32_ are.\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int32.min)\")\n```\n\nThere's also similar Types available such as _Int8, Int16,_ and _Int64_. We only use these specific integer types when we are doing something like cryptography where the way integers are stored is important. We will also run across these types when we are interacting with libraries built when storing 32 bits for an integer was very common. **Most of the time you will simply use the _Int_ type**\n\n## UInt32\n\nWe also have the unsigned integer counterparts as well. Once again we should only be using these specific Integer type when the nature of our program forces us to. **We should use Int for all other cases and let the compiler decide how much memory to allocate when storing integers.**\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(UInt32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(UInt32.min)\")\n```\n\n## Swift is Strongly Typed\n\n_Int, Int32, UInt32_ and all of the other variations of storing integers are all different types. What this means is that if we declare a constant or a variable to be of a specific Type, we can't assign a different type to it, even though they are just numbers.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k6zEyyo.png)\n\n**We want to use Int consistently throughout our code** so that we can leave the hard work to the compiler. We can convert other variations of the _Int Type_ by using this syntax:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt32: Int32 = 3\nvar myNormalInt: Int\n                     // This will not error, because we first convert Int32 to instance of Int Type\nmyNormalInt = Int(myInt32)\n```\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\n\n**There is a finite number of bits a computer has to represent: an infinite amount of numbers**. So how would a computer represent something like 1/3 which is .3333333 with 3's repeating until forever? A computer will try to do its best. The most important concept in this tab is the **while _Int's_ are precise, Floating Point Types are not**.\n\n## Double vs. Float\n\nSwift has two Types to represent numbers with decimals. The first is the **Double Type** which allocates 64 bits to represent a floating point number and the second is the **Float Type** which allocates 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Since a _Double Type_ **has more representations available** to it, it will **store the floating point number more precisely**. Rather than the _Int Type_ where the bits represented how many_ Int's_ it can represent, the extra bits for floating point numbers just represent its precision.\n\n## Double Is the Inferred Type\n\nIf we store a floating point number to a variable or a constant **Swift will automatically assume that it is a Double**. Just like how we want to use _Int's_ in our code as much as possible, we want to **use Doubles as much as possible so we can rely on Swift's type inference.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i0VTX7X.png) \n\n## Operations\n\nWe can perform basic operations in Swift such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\n```swift\nprint(\"Addition \\(1 + 3)\")\nprint(\"Subtraction \\(1 - 3)\")\nprint(\"Multiplication \\(1 * 3)\")\nprint(\"Division \\(1 / 3)\")\n```\n\nWhen we divide an instance of the _Int Type_ with another instance of the _Int Type_, we get another new instance of the _Int Type_. Then what will happen if we divide 1 with 3? We would expect the result to be something like .33333333.  **It results in zero because remember that Int's can only be whole numbers.** If there are decimal points then there is a different _Data Type_ for that. If we divide two _Int's_ together and its result should be represented in a decimal, Swift will just round the number down(even if it's 8.9999)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/numerical_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:55 UTC]]

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["path", "ios/intro_to_osx/value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons. We will just log out that a particular button was pressed for now. We will be able to see the results of the log in our Debug Area of our Xcode.![](http://i.imgur.com/Ewl3vYu.gif)"], ["path", "ios/ios_advanced/connections_ii"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["path", "ios/ios_advanced/ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

Start by adding 4 major vertical stack sections for the top label, middle section to hold our gameboard buttons and two more for our hidden winner label and the reset button.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5898_1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nFrom here we want to add some basic constraints to these 4 stacks. For all of the stack views, we want to add leading, trailing, top, and bottom constraints. We also want to be sure to add height values to **ALL** **BUT** the middle stack. The middle stack does not get a set height constraint due to it being the one that we want to have dynamically changed as the size of the screen and orientation shift.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nWe can add text and buttons to the other stacks on the page as needed now. You will notice that these elements will auto size to the size of the stack they are placed in. The text for the buttons will be centered automatically, but for text in labels to be centered you just need to change the text alignment.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5899_2.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nOnce this is done we want to change the distribution of our middle stack that will hold our gameboard buttons to \"Fill Equally\" so that anything added to it will take up equal percentages of the stack they are contained in. If the distribution is left to \"Fill\" all elements will full size to the container, overlapping each other instead of trying to share the container space.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5900_3.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nThe next thing to do is to add three horizontal stacks that will be inside this middle vertical stack. This is done to represent the rows for the buttons. This system of embedding horizontal stacks in a vertical one or vice versa makes for an easy way of defining a grid system. **Remember these newly added stacks will be needed to be set to a Fill Equally distribution as well just like their parent.**\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5901_4.png)\n\n## Step 6:\n\nWe can now add our buttons to each row simply by dragging them into their respective rows (the horizontal stacks). Easy enough! With that, you can add some styling and background effects to the buttons as desired.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5902_5.png)\n\n**With that, we have fully laid out our TicTacToe App that will work for any orientation.** The only additional thing is currently the buttons are completely touching so if we wanted to add something similar to the padding or margin properties typically found in CSS to the stack we just have to edit the \"spacing\" of these stacks. This can be done by clicking each stack and changing its spacing property found on the right-side editor.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5903_6.png)"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/stack_views"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting. To fix this, we have to add constraints with Auto Layout.**"], ["path", "ios/ios_intern/ui_first"], ["created_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-22 22:16:56 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> (). There's a lot to learn with functions.

There is a minimum and maximum value that an instance of an _Int Type_ can represent. _Int Type_ is signed in Swift. What this means is that **it uses some of its possible representations to store negative numbers**. Let's see what the maximum value and minimum value of the Int Type is in Swift:\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int.min)\")\n```\n\nOn OS X (the desktop operating system) allocates 64 bits to store an _Int Type_. On iOS, this is different because some devices store _Int Types_ in 64 bits while older models such as the iPhone 5 utilize the 32-bit infrastructure. This seems like a big headache. Does that mean we have to write different code for different devices? **If we use the instances of the Int Type, the compiler will determine the appropriate size for an Int when it builds your program.**\n\n## Int32\n\nWe can have an Int be stored in 32 bits by creating an instance of _Int32 Type_. It is important to note that _Int_ and _Int32_ are different Types. _Int32_ is also signed. Let's see what the maximum and the minimum value of _Int32_ are.\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int32.min)\")\n```\n\nThere's also similar Types available such as _Int8, Int16,_ and _Int64_. We only use these specific integer types when we are doing something like cryptography where the way integers are stored is important. We will also run across these types when we are interacting with libraries built when storing 32 bits for an integer was very common. **Most of the time you will simply use the _Int_ type**\n\n## UInt32\n\nWe also have the unsigned integer counterparts as well. Once again we should only be using these specific Integer type when the nature of our program forces us to. **We should use Int for all other cases and let the compiler decide how much memory to allocate when storing integers.**\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(UInt32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(UInt32.min)\")\n```\n\n## Swift is Strongly Typed\n\n_Int, Int32, UInt32_ and all of the other variations of storing integers are all different types. What this means is that if we declare a constant or a variable to be of a specific Type, we can't assign a different type to it, even though they are just numbers.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k6zEyyo.png)\n\n**We want to use Int consistently throughout our code** so that we can leave the hard work to the compiler. We can convert other variations of the _Int Type_ by using this syntax:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt32: Int32 = 3\nvar myNormalInt: Int\n                     // This will not error, because we first convert Int32 to instance of Int Type\nmyNormalInt = Int(myInt32)\n```\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\n\n**There is a finite number of bits a computer has to represent: an infinite amount of numbers**. So how would a computer represent something like 1/3 which is .3333333 with 3's repeating until forever? A computer will try to do its best. The most important concept in this tab is the **while _Int's_ are precise, Floating Point Types are not**.\n\n## Double vs. Float\n\nSwift has two Types to represent numbers with decimals. The first is the **Double Type** which allocates 64 bits to represent a floating point number and the second is the **Float Type** which allocates 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Since a _Double Type_ **has more representations available** to it, it will **store the floating point number more precisely**. Rather than the _Int Type_ where the bits represented how many_ Int's_ it can represent, the extra bits for floating point numbers just represent its precision.\n\n## Double Is the Inferred Type\n\nIf we store a floating point number to a variable or a constant **Swift will automatically assume that it is a Double**. Just like how we want to use _Int's_ in our code as much as possible, we want to **use Doubles as much as possible so we can rely on Swift's type inference.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i0VTX7X.png) \n\n## Operations\n\nWe can perform basic operations in Swift such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\n```swift\nprint(\"Addition \\(1 + 3)\")\nprint(\"Subtraction \\(1 - 3)\")\nprint(\"Multiplication \\(1 * 3)\")\nprint(\"Division \\(1 / 3)\")\n```\n\nWhen we divide an instance of the _Int Type_ with another instance of the _Int Type_, we get another new instance of the _Int Type_. Then what will happen if we divide 1 with 3? We would expect the result to be something like .33333333.  **It results in zero because remember that Int's can only be whole numbers.** If there are decimal points then there is a different _Data Type_ for that. If we divide two _Int's_ together and its result should be represented in a decimal, Swift will just round the number down(even if it's 8.9999)."], ["updated_at", 2017-01-23 22:42:51 UTC], ["id", 13]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times. Have the Lion growl.**\n\nUploadyour playground below."], ["path", "ios/frameworks/animals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

For example, let's say we are having a party for NBA Legends. We only want to allow players with at least 5 rings. We could write the logic something like this:</div>\n\n```swift\n// Declare a variable called rings that is of the Int Type.\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we have more than one condition we can add an _else if_ statement:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else if rings > 2 {\n    print(\"Decent...but \\(rings) rings aren't enough\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe used two comparison operators here. First, we checked if rings were greater than equal to 5\\. We also checked if rings were greater than 2\\. Here is a list of Swift's comparison operators:\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\n## ![](http://i.imgur.com/WzRERYY.png)\n\n## Equality vs. Identity\n\n**There is a difference between equality and identity**. For example == checks whether the instances on the left and the right are equal. **Two instances can be equal, but they don't need to have the same location in memory**. The last two operators are called identity operators. We will be going over the differences more in depth once we start creating our own Data Types.\n\n## Logical Operators\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pZx0B28.png)\n\nWe can use Logical Operators in our Conditionals as well.

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications. It is natural to question whether to use a Class or a Struct, and this will become more and more clear as you use both and see the differences.\n\n### To Do\n\n**Create a struct called \"Card\"**\n\n1.  Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.

Give the Card a property \"numerical_value\" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13\n\n**Next, create a class called \"Deck\"**\n\n1.  Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.  Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards\n\n**Finally, create a class called \"Player\"**\n\n1.  Give the Player class a name property\n2.  Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]\n3.  Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it\n    *   Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class. \n4.  Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/deck_of_cards"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> (). There's a lot to learn with functions.

Apple's libraries are all written in Objective-C. Most educational resources and Stack Overflow questions are for Objective-C. In fact, most applications in the App Store are written in Objective-C and this will be true for at least a few years. It's true that **Apple introduced Swift to eventually replace Objective-C**. In fact, although most of the libraries (like Foundation) that we use in Swift are actually written in Objective-C, Apple is already making a big push in rewriting a lot of this content in Swift. Knowing how to speak this language will help us better understand our errors, develop a deeper understanding of what developing for Apple used to be like, and also understand why Apple decided to introduce a new language. This course will be primarily focused on Swift because it is the **language of the future**. \n\n## Why Swift?\n\nIf you have written Objective-C before, you will completely understand why. Swift is similar to interpreted languages like Ruby and JavaScript. However, it is a compiled language. It's the best of both worlds. There's no one out there right now that can consider themselves as a master of Swift. This is a great opportunity for new programmers like us to start mastering this language that was designed to power all future Apple programs. Everyone's in the same boat. Moreover, Swift is the language of the future for all applications developed in the Apple ecosystem. This offers a great opportunity to learn a new language with a lot of backing and interest.\n\n## Xcode\n\n**Even if you have installed it before make sure that you have the latest one (Xcode 7)**. Swift is constantly evolving with each new version of Xcode and as Swift developers, we have to be up to date with all of the versions. We need to know Xcode really well. This is what we will be using in writing our code. **Xcode is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment** which basically means that it does a lot to help the developer. Unlike our plain text files written using a simple text editor and then run through the terminal, Xcode provides us with the **integrated tools to write, build, test, and debug our code**.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe have to become **self-sufficient iOS developers**. Every year new features will be added with the introduction of new operating systems and new devices. To keep up, we are going to be **spending a lot of time in Apple's documentation**. Good news is that Apple's documentation is fantastic. We will be directing you to Apple's documentation to serve as a supplement to this course and we believe that **learning how to digest** Apple's documentation is the single most important skill for an iOS developer. Let's get started by reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/hello_swift_file_renamed"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

We discussed how **Structs are passed by value** and **Classes are passed by reference**. The second main difference is that **Classes support inheritance** while **Structs do not**. In our Classes example, we created a Person class. Now let's create a Developer class that **inherits** from the Person class.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {         // Note: this function doesn't get called explicitly.  It is called \n                               // when creating an instance using the initialization syntax -- \"Person()\"\n    self.name = name           // Note the use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\") \n                               // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nclass Developer: Person {      // Note how we are specifying that Developer will inherit from Person\n  var favoriteLanguage: String\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage\n    super.init(name: name)\n  }\n  override func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n}\nvar myDeveloper: Developer = Developer(name: \"Jay\", favoriteLanguage: \"Swift\")\nmyDeveloper.speak()\n```\n\nWow, that's a lot of new code! Let's go over it in sections.\n\n### Subclassing\n\nSubclassing refers to creating a new class that is based on another class. This allows our new class to inherit all of the characteristics of the parent class. In our example above we specify that Developer is a subclass of Person in the class definition itself.\n\n```swift\nclass Developer: Person {         // Here we specify that Person is the \"Superclass\"\n  // Developer definition here\n}\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\nWhen we create a subclass, it automatically gains access to the super's init method. But what if we want to add logic to the initialization of just the subclass? In our Developer example, we want to also specify a favoriteLanguage property in the subclass' initialization. We do not want the Person class to have a favoriteLanguage so we declare the property in the Developer class and create another init method.\n\n```swift\n  var favoriteLanguage: String       // Declaring the favoriteLanguage property in Developer means that\n                                     // it is only available in Developer and Developer's subclasses.\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {           // Developer's init method takes in\n                                                           // a name and a favoriteLanguage.\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage               // We set the favoriteLanguage property.\n                                     // We then call the superclass' init method and pass it the name\n    super.init(name: name)           // property since the logic is already written in Person's init.\n  }\n```\n\nThe main thing to remember when creating an init method in a subclass is the use of\n\n<pre> super.init\n```\n\nwhich allows us to call upon the superclass' initialization method.\n\n### Overriding Superclass Methods\n\nBy default, a subclass has access to all of the superclass' methods and properties. However, what if we wanted to override a particular method's functionality. Fortunately Swift allows us to prefix a method name with the override keyword to specify that we will be overriding the default superclass functionality. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n  override func speak() {                    // We specify that we are overriding the speak function.\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n```\n\nNow when we called speak on an instance of Developer it will run the Developer's speak function rather than the superclass speak function."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/inheritance"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Swift is what we call a **statically typed language** what this means is that we need to specifically declare the \"type\" of each of our variables. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n// Variables are used to store data. We declare a variable using the \"var\" keyword.\n// We also have to specify the type of that variable.\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\n// Every variable declaration follows the same format:\n// var variable_name: variable_type = variable_value\n```\n\nAlthough this may seem unnecessary, strongly typed languages allow the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough memory to store the specific data type. Internally, computers store variables in blocks of memory that are just 1s and 0s. Specifying the type allows the computer to understand not only how much actual space to allocate but also how to interpret the 1s and 0s that are stored!\n\nA strongly typed language not only forces you to **declare the type** but, more importantly, disallows you from **changing the type** this means that once a variable is declared as a \"String\" type it must always store a String. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\nname = \"Darth Vader\"  // Changing the \"name\" variable to another string is allowed...\n                      // ...but trying to change the var to a value of ANOTHER type is not allowed.\nname = 42             // THIS WON'T WORK because we are trying to change a variable that is a \"String\"\n                      // type to a value that is a \"Int\" type\n```\n\n**This means that once we declare a variable we can only hold one specific type of data inside of it!**\n\n### Basic Types\n\n```swift\nvar str: String = \"This is a String\"   // \"String\" type.\nvar num: Int = -42                     // \"Int\" type stores whole numbers both negative and positive.\nvar dec: Double = 4.2                  // \"Double\" type stores numbers with decimals (allocates 64 bits).\n```\n\n### Why is Swift Statically Typed?\n\n**Performance**.\n\nMany other languages like Ruby and Javascript are **dynamically typed languages** meaning that we don't need to specifically declare the type and we can change what is stored in a variable back and forth between different types. Although loosely typed languages may be easier for the developer (since the developer doesn't need to worry about types), it reduces performance because now the computer has to worry about remembering types and how to store different values of different types. In addition, the computer now has to allocate extra space for each variable and it has to store them in such a way that the variable can hold any type of information. **Swift is statically typed** so it forces the developer to be more conscious about types and it also allows the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough space for each variable.\n\n# Type Inference\n\nConstantly having to specify the type can get tedious very quickly. Fortunately in addition to caring about performance, Swift also caters to the developer! Swift uses \"type inference\" to allow us to forego specifying the type when declaring a variable and assigning it to a value in the same line. Swift will look at the value and \"infer\" the type so that you don't have to specify it.\n\n```swift\n// Swift has \"type inference\"\nvar name = \"Anakin\"  // String type\n                     // Swift looked at val on the right and inferred type: we didn't have to specify!\n```\n\n#### Even though we didn't have to specify the type, the variable still has a type that cannot change after a declaration.\n\n```swift\nvar name = \"Anakin\"            // Type inferred as String based on the value \"Anakin\"\nname = 42                      // THIS IS STILL NOT ALLOWED since name is a \"String\" type\n```\n\n**Take a minute and try out the above code in a playground and see what the error message is.**\n\n# Constants\n\n**Variables hold data that varies**. In many programming languages, variables are used for everything, even for values that never change. **Constants hold data that does not vary**. We cannot change constants. Constants are a big deal in Swift. **Use constants in all parts of your code except for areas where you HAVE to use a variable**. Using constants to hold data that won't change allows our code to be more explicit while at the same time helps the compiler to run our programs more effectively. \n\nWe declare constants using the \"let\" keyword:\n\n```swift\n                            // Declare name as a constant because we anticipate that it will NOT change.\nlet name: String = \"Anakin Skywalker\"\n                            // Note that just like variables, constants also have types\n                            // Now we cannot change the name:\nname = \"Darth Vader\"        // THIS WON'T WORK because name is a constant so we CANNOT change it.\n```\n\n## Mutable vs. Immutable\n\n**Mutable** means that we can change the value and** immutable** means that we cannot change the value. In Objective-C, there were _explicit Types_ that were indicated as Immutable. For example, there was a class for mutable_ String Types_ and a separate class for immutable _String Types_. In Swift, we can still have immutable and mutable Strings without having another class because of the difference between the_ let _and the _var_ keywords.\n\nWe use the keyword_ let _when we want to declare a constant. **Constants** are values that are not going to change during your program. We use the_ var _keyword when we want to hold onto a value that might change. Using these keywords we can create mutable strings and immutable strings.\n\n```swift\n                                // We are declaring a mutable string because we store it in a var.\nvar myMutableString = \"change me\"\n                                // We are declaring an immutable string because we store it in a const.\nlet myImmutableString = \"can't change\"\n                                // We can change the value of a mutable string...\nmyMutableString += \"!\"\n                                // ...but we cannot change the value of an immutable string.\nmyImmutableString += \"ahhhh\"    // This will error.\n```\n\nThis is the same for Arrays.\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a mutable array because we are storing it in a variable.\nvar myMutableArray = [\"one\"]\n// We are declaring an immutable array because we are storing it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableArray = [\"uno\"]\n// We can append new String instances to the mutable array...\nmyMutableArray.append(\"two\")\n// ... in fact we can add new things to this mutable array as well...\nmyMutableArray + [\"three\", \"four\"]\n// ...but we will get an error when we try to do the same to an immutable array.\nmyImmutableArray.append(\"dos\")\n```\n\nAnd for dictionaries.\n\n```swift\n                          // We are declaring a mutable dictionary because we store it in a variable.\nvar myMutableDictionary = [\"one\": 1]\n                          // We are declaring an immutable dictionary because we store it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableDictionary = [\"uno\": 1]\n                          // We can add a new key-value pair to our mutable dictionary ...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"two\"] = 2\n                          // ... or update a value of an existing key...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"one\"] = 0\n                          // ... but we get an error when we try to do same to an immutable dictionary.\nmyImmutableDictionary[\"uno\"] = 2\n```"], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/let_and_var"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

If we want to execute a set of code repeatedly for a given number of iterations or until it reaches a specific condition, we will use loops. There are two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. We **use the for loop when we know beforehand how many times we are going to have to repeat the code** while we **use the while loop when we don't know how many times we have to run the code, but we know we have to run the code until it reaches a particular condition.** However, at their core, they are both the same, we can do whatever you can do with a for loop instead of a while loop and vice versa.\n\n## For-in Loops\n\nA **for-in loop performs a set of code in a specific range, sequence, or collection**. For now, we will focus on using the for-in loop with a range. Go ahead and run the following code below, in the playground, and see what the output is from the Assistant Editor.\n\n```swift\n// loop from 1 to 5 including 5\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from 1 to 5 excluding 5\nfor i in 1..<5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nYou can just as easily use variables to create a range as well!\n\n```swift\nvar start = 0\nvar end = 5\n// loop from start to end including end\nfor i in start...end {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from start to end excluding end\nfor i in start..<end {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nNote that when writing for loops in Swift, you will always use the \"for-in\" style with a range. Although you can still use the C-style for loops with the separate initialization, condition, and increment clauses it has been deprecated in Swift 2.x and will be taken out altogether in Swift 3.\n\n## While Loops\n\nA **while loop is used to loop for an unknown number of times.** Unlike a For-in loop where you first specify a range to loop through, in a while loop, we simply specify a condition. Anything that we write with a for-in loop can be written with a while loop. Let's see how we can convert our for-in loops to while loops.\n\nWe can re-write this _**for-in**_ loop...\n\n```swift\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\n... as a **_while_** loop.\n\n```swift\nvar i = 1\nwhile i < 6 {\n    print(i)\n    i = i+1\n}\n```\n\nNote that the while loop syntax requires us to create our own bounds. In later assignments, you may find situations where you don't know how many times you will need to repeat before entering the loop in these situations it is important to know how to use a while loop."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/loops"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

There is a minimum and maximum value that an instance of an _Int Type_ can represent. _Int Type_ is signed in Swift. What this means is that **it uses some of its possible representations to store negative numbers**. Let's see what the maximum value and minimum value of the Int Type is in Swift:\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int.min)\")\n```\n\nOn OS X (the desktop operating system) allocates 64 bits to store an _Int Type_. On iOS, this is different because some devices store _Int Types_ in 64 bits while older models such as the iPhone 5 utilize the 32-bit infrastructure. This seems like a big headache. Does that mean we have to write different code for different devices? **If we use the instances of the Int Type, the compiler will determine the appropriate size for an Int when it builds your program.**\n\n## Int32\n\nWe can have an Int be stored in 32 bits by creating an instance of _Int32 Type_. It is important to note that _Int_ and _Int32_ are different Types. _Int32_ is also signed. Let's see what the maximum and the minimum value of _Int32_ are.\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int32.min)\")\n```\n\nThere's also similar Types available such as _Int8, Int16,_ and _Int64_. We only use these specific integer types when we are doing something like cryptography where the way integers are stored is important. We will also run across these types when we are interacting with libraries built when storing 32 bits for an integer was very common. **Most of the time you will simply use the _Int_ type**\n\n## UInt32\n\nWe also have the unsigned integer counterparts as well. Once again we should only be using these specific Integer type when the nature of our program forces us to. **We should use Int for all other cases and let the compiler decide how much memory to allocate when storing integers.**\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(UInt32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(UInt32.min)\")\n```\n\n## Swift is Strongly Typed\n\n_Int, Int32, UInt32_ and all of the other variations of storing integers are all different types. What this means is that if we declare a constant or a variable to be of a specific Type, we can't assign a different type to it, even though they are just numbers.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k6zEyyo.png)\n\n**We want to use Int consistently throughout our code** so that we can leave the hard work to the compiler. We can convert other variations of the _Int Type_ by using this syntax:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt32: Int32 = 3\nvar myNormalInt: Int\n                     // This will not error, because we first convert Int32 to instance of Int Type\nmyNormalInt = Int(myInt32)\n```\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\n\n**There is a finite number of bits a computer has to represent: an infinite amount of numbers**. So how would a computer represent something like 1/3 which is .3333333 with 3's repeating until forever? A computer will try to do its best. The most important concept in this tab is the **while _Int's_ are precise, Floating Point Types are not**.\n\n## Double vs. Float\n\nSwift has two Types to represent numbers with decimals. The first is the **Double Type** which allocates 64 bits to represent a floating point number and the second is the **Float Type** which allocates 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Since a _Double Type_ **has more representations available** to it, it will **store the floating point number more precisely**. Rather than the _Int Type_ where the bits represented how many_ Int's_ it can represent, the extra bits for floating point numbers just represent its precision.\n\n## Double Is the Inferred Type\n\nIf we store a floating point number to a variable or a constant **Swift will automatically assume that it is a Double**. Just like how we want to use _Int's_ in our code as much as possible, we want to **use Doubles as much as possible so we can rely on Swift's type inference.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i0VTX7X.png) \n\n## Operations\n\nWe can perform basic operations in Swift such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\n```swift\nprint(\"Addition \\(1 + 3)\")\nprint(\"Subtraction \\(1 - 3)\")\nprint(\"Multiplication \\(1 * 3)\")\nprint(\"Division \\(1 / 3)\")\n```\n\nWhen we divide an instance of the _Int Type_ with another instance of the _Int Type_, we get another new instance of the _Int Type_. Then what will happen if we divide 1 with 3? We would expect the result to be something like .33333333.  **It results in zero because remember that Int's can only be whole numbers.** If there are decimal points then there is a different _Data Type_ for that.

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break. To see the output we can click the small up arrow on the bottom left of the playground.

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["path", "ios/intro_to_osx/value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons. We will just log out that a particular button was pressed for now.

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["path", "ios/ios_advanced/ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

You can think of stacks as similar to divs in HTML that act as containers. We will be remaking the previous assignment of TicTacToe with stack views. Using Stack Views make building interfaces much easier in iOS so let's get started with them!\n\n**_**Keep in mind stack views are not a complete replacement for auto-layout, but rather an additional tool to make the auto-layout process easier**_**\n\n## Step 1:\n\nSimilar to HTML/CSS divs layouts we want to start by laying out the major areas of our app that will be contained in stacks first then proceed to add elements inside of them. Start by adding 4 major vertical stack sections for the top label, middle section to hold our gameboard buttons and two more for our hidden winner label and the reset button.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5898_1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nFrom here we want to add some basic constraints to these 4 stacks. For all of the stack views, we want to add leading, trailing, top, and bottom constraints. We also want to be sure to add height values to **ALL** **BUT** the middle stack. The middle stack does not get a set height constraint due to it being the one that we want to have dynamically changed as the size of the screen and orientation shift.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nWe can add text and buttons to the other stacks on the page as needed now. You will notice that these elements will auto size to the size of the stack they are placed in. The text for the buttons will be centered automatically, but for text in labels to be centered you just need to change the text alignment.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5899_2.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nOnce this is done we want to change the distribution of our middle stack that will hold our gameboard buttons to \"Fill Equally\" so that anything added to it will take up equal percentages of the stack they are contained in. If the distribution is left to \"Fill\" all elements will full size to the container, overlapping each other instead of trying to share the container space.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5900_3.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nThe next thing to do is to add three horizontal stacks that will be inside this middle vertical stack. This is done to represent the rows for the buttons. This system of embedding horizontal stacks in a vertical one or vice versa makes for an easy way of defining a grid system. **Remember these newly added stacks will be needed to be set to a Fill Equally distribution as well just like their parent.**\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5901_4.png)\n\n## Step 6:\n\nWe can now add our buttons to each row simply by dragging them into their respective rows (the horizontal stacks). Easy enough! With that, you can add some styling and background effects to the buttons as desired.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5902_5.png)\n\n**With that, we have fully laid out our TicTacToe App that will work for any orientation.** The only additional thing is currently the buttons are completely touching so if we wanted to add something similar to the padding or margin properties typically found in CSS to the stack we just have to edit the \"spacing\" of these stacks. This can be done by clicking each stack and changing its spacing property found on the right-side editor.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5903_6.png)"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/stack_views"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

This is where we will spend all of our time building our iOS applications. The main parts of XCode are **Toolbar**, **Navigator**, **Jump Bar**, **Utility Area**, **Editor Area,** and **Debug Area**. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/FGI1hqc.png)\n\n## Our First Application\n\n**The best way to learn iOS is by building applications**. Let's go build our first iOS app and name it \"iOSQuiz\". **Go ahead and click create a new project**.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AlUlb6j.gif)\n\nWhen we clicked, create a new project. A template selection window will show. Here we can choose a project template to use as a starting point of our application. We will be using the **Single View Application** for our first application. Then we will be directed to the project options sheet where we have to specify these fields:\n\n*   **Product Name**: This will be the name of our folder that holds the files to our application\n*   **Organization Name**: XCode automatically inserts a copyright notice into every source code file you create\n*   **Organization Identifier**: Use reverse domain name notation (i.e. com.codingdojo)\n*   **Bundle Identifier**: XCode combines the Product Name and Company Identifier to generate a unique Bundle Identifier\n*   **Language**: We will be using Swift.\n*   **Devices**: XCode wants to know what types of devices we are building the application for\n*   **Use Core Data**: Leave this unchecked for now. Core Data is one of the ways we can make data persist in our applications\n\n## Toolbar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/s7WOHso.png)\n\n1.  On the left side of the toolbar, we have iTunes like button. **The play button starts building and running our application while the stop button stops it**. \n2.  We can also specify where to run our application to the right of the stop button. **We can either run the application on one of our devices or a host of simulators that XCode provides for us**. \n3.  The box in the middle of our XCode is called the activity view. **Activity View displays and actions or processes that are currently happening**.\n4.  On the right of the Toolbar, we have a section for selecting what kind of editor we want to use and also a series of three buttons that help us maintain the screen real estate on our screen. Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting. To fix this, we have to add constraints with Auto Layout.**"], ["path", "ios/ios_intern/ui_first"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:09:02 UTC]]

Apple gives us access to the iOS framework to build mobile applications, and the different APIs in the framework are built on heavy OOP principles that involve inheritance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand inheritance so that you can navigate the iOS landscape more easily. \n\n### To Do\n\n**First, create a class called Animal**\n\n1.  Give Animal a property \"name\"\n2.  Give Animal a property \"health\" with a default value of 100\n3.  Give Animal an initialization that takes in a name and sets the name property appropriately\n4.  Give the animal a displayHealth method\n\n**Next, create a subclass of Animal called Cat**\n\n1.  Give the Cat a method \"growl\" that prints to the screen \"Rawr!\"\n2.  Modify the Cat's health to be 150\n3.  Give the Cat a method \"run\" that prints to the screen \"Running\" and deducts 10 health\n\n**Next, create two subclasses of Cat - Cheetah and Lion**\n\n1.  Override the growl method of the Lion to make it print \"ROAR!!!! I am the King of the Jungle\"\n2.  Override Lion's health to be 200\n3.  Override the Cheetah's run method to print \"Running Fast\" and deduct 50 health \n4.  Add a sleep function to the Cheetah class that adds 50 health (make sure that the Cheetah's health limit remains 200)\n\n**Create a Cheetah. Have the Cheetah run 4 times. Display the Cheetah's health. Now modify the _Cat's_ run method so that it cannot run if it does not have the required health.**\n\n**Create a Lion. Have the Lion run 3 times. Have the Lion growl.**\n\nUploadyour playground below."], ["path", "ios/frameworks/animals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Swift provides us with two Collection types: Array and Dictionary. First, we will go over the Array. **Arrays are an ordered collection of values**. On the other hand, **Dictionaries are an unordered collection of key-value pairs**. Let's first go over Arrays. Each position is defined with an index starting at 0\\. It's a lot easier to explain with examples.\n\nWe will declare a variable _toDoList_ to be of an **instance of the Array Type** which will hold onto an **ordered collection of instances of the String Type**. The [] brackets denote the Array type and inside of the brackets we place the type of the values that we'll be storing.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [\"Learn iOS\", \"Build the next Flappy Bird\", \"Retire in Cancun\"]\n```\n\nHere we are declaring the toDoList _and_ giving it some values to begin with. What if we wanted to start with no tasks and then gradually add them on? We would have to initialize an empty array like so:\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList: [String] = [String]()              // Setting the array type and initializing the array\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nEvery Instance of Array has the \"append\" method that allows you to add elements to the Array collection.\n\nNow if we are initializing an instance of an _Array Type_ that will hold onto instances of the _String Type_, we can get rid of the type annotation because Swift will be able to infer its type with_ [String]()_ just like value types.\n\n```swift\nvar toDoList = [String]()\ntoDoList.append(\"Learn iOS\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Build the next Flappy Bird\")\ntoDoList.append(\"Retire in Cancun\")\nprint(toDoList)\n```\n\nJust like how we could not assign an_ Int _to a variable or a constant that was declared to hold a different _Type_, if we try to append an instance of a _Type_ that is not a _String_, Swift will throw us an error.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kGFlfDV.png)\n\nAccessing Arrays\n\nArrays are zero indexed. What this means is the first instance inside of an _Array_ lives at index 0\\. The second instance inside of an Array lives at index 1. \n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      // Note that we let Swift infer the type here\n// The first number lives at index 0.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0])\")\n// The second number lives at index 1.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1])\")\n// The third number lives at index 2.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2])\")\n// The fourth number lives at index 3.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[3])\")\n// The fifth number lives at index 4.\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[4])\")\n```\n\nWe used ranges in our _for-in_ loops. Ranges can be used to index instances of the _Array Type_ as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// => \"[1, 2]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[0...1])\")\n// => \"[2, 3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[1..<4])\")\n// => \"[3, 4]\"\nprint(\"\\(arrayOfInts[2...3])\")\n```\n\nAfter we access an Array using its index, we can set the value at that particular index as well.\n\n```swift\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\narr[0] = 8\nprint(arr)      // The array has now changed!\n```\n\n## Methods and Properties\n\nArrays have several methods and properties -- these are just a few that will help you use and modify your collections.\n\n### append()\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 18px;\">We already saw how we could append instances to an _Array_. We use the append method to add a given element to the array. This method is very similar to push methods in other languages:</div>\n\n```swift\nvar nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nnums.append(5)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n### removeAtIndex()\n\nWe can run the method _removeAtIndex_ on an Array and provide the index of the element we want to delete. This method is going to return the particular instance that we are removing from the_ Array_ while removing that instance from the _Array._\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar popped = arrayOfInts.removeAtIndex(0)\nprint(popped)\nprint(arrayOfInts)\n```\n\n### insert()\n\nWe run the _insert_ method with two arguments. The first argument is the value that we would like to add to the _Array _and the second argument is the index where we would like to insert it. When we pass in the second argument, we have to give it a name _atIndex_. We will be going over these named parameters more in the Functions tab.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: 5)\n```\n\n### count\n\nThe _Count _is a property of the_ Array Types._ It holds the total number of elements in an _Array. _This property is very useful when we are looping through an _Array._ We can write the previous code using the count method.\n\n```swift\nvar arrayOfInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narrayOfInts.insert(6, atIndex: arrayOfInts.count - 1)\n```\n\n## Looping Through Arrays\n\nThe _for-in_ loop makes looping through all instances within an _Array_ a breeze.\n\n```swift\nvar starters = [\"Fisher\", \"Kobe\", \"Gasol\", \"Bynum\", \"World Peace\"]\nfor starter in starters {\n    print(starter)\n}\n```\n\nOr we can use a range as well along with the count property:\n\n```swift\nfor i in 0..<starters.count {\n    print(starters[i])\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/arrays"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Let's start with classes.\n\n## Classes\n\nClasses in Swift allow you to define the blueprint of a particular type and then create instances of that type (also known as Objects). This paradigm of creating your own types and then instantiating them is known as **Object Oriented Programming** and becomes very powerful when creating large scale applications with multiple components. Let's start by creating a class:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")\n```\n\nHere we have created the class Person that has one **property** \"species\" and then we create an instance of the person called \"myPerson\". Note that we are declaring the type of myPerson to be the class that we defined above. This means we can create our own types!\n\n### Stored Properties\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\n```\n\nHere the Person class has  **one stored property and it has a default value of \"H. Sapiens\"**. Since we declared the property as a variable it is both readable and writable (meaning we can access it _and_ change it).\n\n```swift\nvar myPerson = Person()                 // Note use of type inference to infer that it is \"Person\" type\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // We can change the property\nprint(\"\\(myPerson.species)\")            // And we can access it!\n```\n\nWe can  **create read-only properties by simply declaring properties as a constant**. Since the values can't be changed, it can't be written which makes it a read-only property.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    let species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n}\nvar myPerson = Person()\nmyPerson.species = \"Homo Sapiens\"       // ! => Cannot assign to 'species' in myPerson\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n**Methods are functions that are associated with a Type**. While properties define what an instance \"knows\", methods define what an instance \"can do\". Let's see methods in action with our Person example.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species)\")   // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person()\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties\n```\n\n### Method Parameter Names\n\nSo far we only implemented methods that take no arguments. Methods and functions are very similar.  **Methods are just functions associated with a Type**. **The first argument of a method does not get an external parameter name**, but all other arguments get external parameter names. If a method only has one argument, the same rule applies which means the argument does not get an external name.\n\n```swift\nclass User {\n    var intelligence = 0\n    func studyForTopic(topic: String, hours: Int) {\n        print(\"I am studying \\(topic) for \\(hours) hours\")\n    }\n}\nvar user = User()\nuser.studyForTopic(\"Math\", hours: 12)\n```\n\nIt is common practice to  **write the name of the first argument in the actual function name** ('Topic') because the **f****irst argument is not going to get an external parameter name**. By following this practice, it becomes very clear what each argument does. **M****ethods do not give free external parameter names for the first argument but do give external parameter names for all arguments afterwards.**\n\n### **Initialization**\n\nInitialization is the **operation of setting up an instance of a type**. It helps us create an instance with appropriate values. So far, we didn't have to worry about initializer because **we have been giving default stored values when defining properties**. However, if we want more control over how an instance of a Type is created, we will have to write our own initializer.\n\nLet's add a name property to our Person class and then add the code to allow a user to specify the name when initializing the instance.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {   // Note this function doesn't get called explicitly. It is called \n                         // when creating an instance using initialization syntax -- \"Person()\".\n    self.name = name     // Note use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property.\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\")\n                                             // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\".\n  }\n}\nvar myPerson: Person = Person(name: \"Jay\")   // Now we have to pass a param to Person initialization.\nmyPerson.speak()                             // Note we call method similar to how we access properties.\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/classes"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

For example, let's say we are having a party for NBA Legends. We only want to allow players with at least 5 rings. We could write the logic something like this:</div>\n\n```swift\n// Declare a variable called rings that is of the Int Type.\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we have more than one condition we can add an _else if_ statement:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nif rings >= 5 {\n    print(\"You are welcome to join the party\")\n} else if rings > 2 {\n    print(\"Decent...but \\(rings) rings aren't enough\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Go win some more rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe used two comparison operators here. First, we checked if rings were greater than equal to 5\\. We also checked if rings were greater than 2\\. Here is a list of Swift's comparison operators:\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\n## ![](http://i.imgur.com/WzRERYY.png)\n\n## Equality vs. Identity\n\n**There is a difference between equality and identity**. For example == checks whether the instances on the left and the right are equal. **Two instances can be equal, but they don't need to have the same location in memory**. The last two operators are called identity operators. We will be going over the differences more in depth once we start creating our own Data Types.\n\n## Logical Operators\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pZx0B28.png)\n\nWe can use Logical Operators in our Conditionals as well. Let's say we want to change the criteria for entering our NBA Legends party. Let's say you have to have at least 5 rings AND have the name Kobe to enter the party:\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nlet name = \"Kobe\"\nif rings >= 5 && name == \"Kobe\" {\n  print(\"Welcome to the party \\(name), congratulations on your \\(rings) rings\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can change our criteria and say that you have to have at least 5 rings or have at least 3 All-Star appearances.\n\n```swift\nvar rings = 5\nvar numOfAllStarAppearances = 17\nif rings >= 5 || numOfAllStarAppearances > 3 {\n  print(\"Welcome you are truly a legend\")\n}\n```\n\nOr we can just let in everyone who is not crazy.\n\n```swift\nvar crazy = true\nif !crazy {\n    print(\"Let's party!\")\n}\n```"], ["path", "ios/frameworks/conditionals"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

This assignment is designed to help you understand the differences between Classes and Structs so that you can choose the best construct for your needs when building your own applications.

Give the Card struct a property \"value\" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String\n2.

Give the Deck class a property called \"cards\" of type [Card]\n2.  When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its \"cards\" property\n3.  Give the Deck a deal method that selects the \"top-most\" card, removes it, and returns it\n4.  Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards\n5.

When we want to look for a definition, or value of a particular word in a dictionary, we look up the word in the dictionary and read its definition. A **Dictionary Type is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs**. A _key_ maps to a value just like a word in a dictionary maps to a definition. \n\n## Initializing a Dictionary\n\n```swift\n// Here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as\n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar myDict2: [String: Int]\n```\n\nOnce again, if we just declare a variable or a constant to be of the _Dictionary Type_, **we will get an error when we try to do something with it because we have not initialized it yet.**\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2: [String: Int] = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nOf course, we can use Swift's type inference:\n\n```swift\nvar myDict2 = [String: Int]()\n```\n\nWe can declare, initialize and set the values of the Dictionary in one line:\n\n```swift\n// here we are declaring myDict variable to be of Dictionary Type that will use instances of String as \n// its keys and instances of Int as its values\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 24,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\n// Note how we are leveraging Swift's type inference here\n```\n\n## Accessing a Dictionary\n\nWe can access _Dictionaries_ just like how we accessed Arrays. **We just have to provide the key in-between brackets**. However unlike Arrays where the keys are instances of _Ints_ and are zero-index based, Dictionary** _keys_ can really be anything** and are not particularly ordered. We can access Kobe's number this way from the previous dictionary that we created:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"]\n```\n\nOn the Playground's right pane, it will say that the value is 24 but don't be fooled. **When we access a Dictionary we get back an Optional Type**. This makes sense because there is a chance that a key doesn't exist in the dictionary. For example, the word 'gullible' might not exist in the _Dictionary_, therefore, it makes sense that when you access a _Dictionary_, **Swift will warn us that it might be nil by returning an Optional**. We can see this safety net in action when we try to store the result of the access to a separate variable:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] \nprint(jerseyNumber) // Optional is not unwrapped\n```\n\nWe can be very bold and just unwrap it:\n\n```swift\nvar jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"]!\nprint(jerseyNumber)\n```\n\nBut it is better practice to use **Optional Binding**:\n\n```swift\nif let jerseyNumber = dictionary[\"Kobe\"] {\n    print(jerseyNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying a Dictionary\n\nWe can modify a Dictionary in a similar way we did with Arrays.\n\n```swift\nvar dictionary = [\n    \"Kobe\": 8,\n    \"Lebron\": 23,\n    \"Rondo\": 9\n]\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Fisher\"] = 2\nprint(dictionary)\ndictionary[\"Kobe\"] = 24\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nIf the _key_ exists, we update the value of what is on the right-hand side of the equals sign. If the_ key_ doesn't exist, we add a new _key_ to the dictionary along with the value we provided on the right of the equals sign.\n\n## Removing\n\nWe can remove a _key-value_ pair by accessing the key and giving it the value of _nil_:\n\n```swift\ndictionary[\"Lebron\"] = nil\n```\n\nOr we can send the message _removeValueForKey_.\n\n```swift\nvar lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\")\nprint(lebronsNumber)\n```\n\nIt is important to note that **this message returns an Optional Type that might contain the value of the key-value pair that was deleted**. Once again it makes sense that this method returns an _Optional Type_ because the key specified by the user might not be present in the dictionary. We can unwrap it with Optional Binding:\n\n```swift\nif let lebronsNumber = dictionary.removeValueForKey(\"Lebron\") {\n    print(lebronsNumber)\n}\n```\n\n## Looping\n\nWe can use the _for-in_ loop to loop through the _keys_ and the values of Dictionaries. \n\n```swift\nfor (key, value) in dictionary {\n    print(\"The key is \\(key) and the value is \\(value)\")\n}\n```\n\nThe (_key, value_) is of the _Tuple type_. Read more about **Tuples** in the Tuples section in  [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID329).\n\n```swift\nfor x in dictionary {\n    print(x)\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't provide the (_key, value_) then Swift will print out a _tuple_ for each _key-value_ pair. Tuples ARE (key, value) pairs."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/dictionaries"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we **call its name, pass along the necessary input, and it will give us back some kind of output (most)**. Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program. For example:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nHere we defined a function with a **func** keyword and declared its name to be _say__Hello_, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.\n\n```swift\nsayHello()\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by **calling its name and passing in the necessary input**. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the **Assistant Editor**.\n\n## Function Parameters\n\n<div>We define what kind of input we want by **declaring parameters.** Let's declare a parameter named 'name' that will be of the String Type. Our function will still not return anything but its side effect will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only **declare a parameter name but also give the parameter a specific type.**</div>\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String) {\n    print(\"Hello, \\(name), how are you doing today?\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.\n\n```swift\nsayHello(\"Andrew\")\n```\n\nWait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, **'name' is a parameter** while **\"Andrew\" is an argument**. We **define parameters.** We **pass in arguments** into functions.\n\n## Function With Multiple Parameters\n\nIf our function has multiple parameters, we have to invoke it in a different way. Previously, we were able to invoke a function by just passing in the argument if the function had one parameter.\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10)                  // \"My width is 10\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one parameter, we have to **provide parameter names for all arguments except for the first one.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescription(w: Int, h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescription(10, h: 20)           // My width is 10 and my height is 20\nprintDescription(10, 20)              // Error: missing argument label 'h:' in call\n```\n\n## Parameter Names\n\nSometimes having an **external parameter name** helps make our functions more expressive. We can give external parameter names so that when we use the function there's a higher chance that we pass in the right arguments:\n\n```swift\n                                      // The two parameters have external names of width and height\n                                      // and internal names of w and h\nfunc printDescription(width w: Int, height h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\n                                      // The func can be invoked by calling its name and passing in\n                                      // right arguments with corresponding external parameter names.\nprintDescription(width: 10, height: 20)\n```\n\nHowever, it is more Swift-like to leave out the external parameter name for the first argument and instead have the function name describe what the first parameter should be. **This convention is used a lot in Swift and is highly recommended in your own code.**\n\n```swift\nfunc printDescriptionWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) {\n    print(\"My width is \\(w) and my height is \\(h)\")\n}\nprintDescriptionWithWidth(10, andHeight: 20)\n```\n\n## Constants v. Variables\n\nWhen we pass in an argument to a function, our function **assigns the value to a constant** with the name of the **internal parameter name**. This becomes clear when we try to modify the constant.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1           // This throws an error because we are trying to modify a constant.\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to modify the argument we have to **specify** that we want to store it in a **variable**.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\n```\n\nHowever when we are passing in an argument and modifying it, its changes will not reflect outside of the function call for value types. We will be going over value types vs. reference types in the next chapter. Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, Bool, and Ints are Value  Types. Classes and functions are reference types. Here's a quick peek at what's coming ahead. When we have a function that changes a value of an Int, its changes will not persist outside of the function:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(var someInt: Int) {\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(myInt)     // => 2\nprint(myInt)           // => 1\n```\n\nIf we want to be able to make changes within a function to a specific instance of a Value type we need **in-out parameters**.\n\n## In-out Parameters\n\nIf we want to modify an argument and we want that change to appear on the outside of the function call, we need in-out parameters. There are two prerequisites to in-out parameters. First, we have to specify that our parameter is an in-out by prefixing the parameter name with _in-out. _Next, when we invoke the function we have to pass in an argument with the '&' sign prefixed to it. Think of the '&' sign as **passing the memory address of the particular constant or variable** so that the function can go directly there and modify it so that the changes will persist outside of the function.\n\n```swift\nvar myInt = 1\nfunc changeMyInt(inout someInt: Int) {         // must specify \"inout\"\n    someInt = someInt + 1\n    print(someInt)\n}\nchangeMyInt(&myInt)                            // must pass in the variable with \"&\" symbol\nprint(myInt)\n```\n\n## Default Parameter Values\n\nIt's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our sayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say \"Hey, buddy.\"\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") {\n    print(\"Hey \\(name)\")\n}\n                 // We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...\nsayHello()\n                 // ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used\nsayHello(\"Yoda\")\n```\n\n## Return\n\nSo far none of our functions had any tangible output. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our _sayHello_ function and observe the differences:\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello(name: String = \"buddy\") -> String {\n    return \"Hey \\(name)\"\n}\nvar greeting: String?\ngreeting = sayHello()\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThis time, we are returning an instance of a String Type from our function. We have to specify in our function declaration that we are going to return an instance of a String Type. This is a **binding contract**, Swift will throw us an error when we construct our code in a way where an instance of a String Type might not return. Let's look at another example.\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(w: Int, andHeight h: Int) -> Int {\n    return w * h\n}\nvar area = calculateAreaOfRectangleWithWidth(10, andHeight: 3)\nprint(area)\n```\n\nHere, our function has two parameters that will both be an instance of Int Type and our function promises to return an instance of an Int Type. If we want to return a value in some cases, we just have to specify that our function will return an Optional Type. For example:\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a function named lookForSomethingIn and declaring two parameters.\n// The first parameter will be an instance of Dictionary, with keys being instances of String\n// and values being instances of Int.\n// The first parameter has no external name but it has an internal name of dictionary.\n// The second parameter will be an instance of a String.\n// It has an external name of forKey and an internal name of key.\n// This function promises to return an Optional Type that can either be nil or hold an instance of Int.\nfunc lookForSomethingIn(dictionary: [String: Int], forKey key: String) -> Int? {\n    if let value = dictionary[key] {\n        return value\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\nvar jerseyNumber = lookForSomethingIn(jerseyNumbers, forKey: \"Kobe\")\nif let num = jerseyNumber {\n    print(num)\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n\nScope describes the **visibility an instance or a function will have**. Anything within a function's scope will be visible to that function. Every time we type {} we can think of it as creating a new inner scope within the current scope. The inner scopes will have access to the outer scopes while outer scopes do not have access to inner scopes.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iqoGfQq.png)\n\n## Function Types\n\nSo what's a function's type? Let's look at the following function:\n\n```swift\nfunc findMinOf(arr: [Int]) -> Int? {\n    if arr.count > 0 {\n        var min = arr[0]\n        for num in arr {\n            if num < min {\n                min = num\n            }\n        }\n        return min\n    } else {\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in one argument of an instance of Array that holds a collection of Ints and returns an Optional Type that **may contain nil or contain a value of an instance of an Int**. This function is an instance of ([Int]) -> Int? type. The function's parameters are listed on the left side of the parentheses and the return type comes after the ->.\n\nLet's look at another example. What type is this function?\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't return anything we don't have to specify that we aren't returning anything in our function declaration. However, this function can be rewritten this way more explicitly.\n\n```swift\nfunc sayHello() -> () {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function is an instance of the Type of () -> ().

Apple's libraries are all written in Objective-C. Most educational resources and Stack Overflow questions are for Objective-C. In fact, most applications in the App Store are written in Objective-C and this will be true for at least a few years. It's true that **Apple introduced Swift to eventually replace Objective-C**. In fact, although most of the libraries (like Foundation) that we use in Swift are actually written in Objective-C, Apple is already making a big push in rewriting a lot of this content in Swift. Knowing how to speak this language will help us better understand our errors, develop a deeper understanding of what developing for Apple used to be like, and also understand why Apple decided to introduce a new language. This course will be primarily focused on Swift because it is the **language of the future**. \n\n## Why Swift?\n\nIf you have written Objective-C before, you will completely understand why. Swift is similar to interpreted languages like Ruby and JavaScript. However, it is a compiled language. It's the best of both worlds. There's no one out there right now that can consider themselves as a master of Swift. This is a great opportunity for new programmers like us to start mastering this language that was designed to power all future Apple programs. Everyone's in the same boat. Moreover, Swift is the language of the future for all applications developed in the Apple ecosystem. This offers a great opportunity to learn a new language with a lot of backing and interest.\n\n## Xcode\n\n**Even if you have installed it before make sure that you have the latest one (Xcode 7)**. Swift is constantly evolving with each new version of Xcode and as Swift developers, we have to be up to date with all of the versions. We need to know Xcode really well. This is what we will be using in writing our code. **Xcode is an IDE or Integrated Development Environment** which basically means that it does a lot to help the developer. Unlike our plain text files written using a simple text editor and then run through the terminal, Xcode provides us with the **integrated tools to write, build, test, and debug our code**.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe have to become **self-sufficient iOS developers**. Every year new features will be added with the introduction of new operating systems and new devices. To keep up, we are going to be **spending a lot of time in Apple's documentation**. Good news is that Apple's documentation is fantastic. We will be directing you to Apple's documentation to serve as a supplement to this course and we believe that **learning how to digest** Apple's documentation is the single most important skill for an iOS developer. Let's get started by reading [About Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/hello_swift_file_renamed"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

We discussed how **Structs are passed by value** and **Classes are passed by reference**. The second main difference is that **Classes support inheritance** while **Structs do not**. In our Classes example, we created a Person class. Now let's create a Developer class that **inherits** from the Person class.\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var species = \"H. Sapiens\"\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {         // Note: this function doesn't get called explicitly.  It is called \n                               // when creating an instance using the initialization syntax -- \"Person()\"\n    self.name = name           // Note the use of \"self\" here to refer to the name property\n  }\n  func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a \\(self.species) and my name is \\(self.name)\") \n                               // Note how we refer to the properties using \"self\"\n  }\n}\nclass Developer: Person {      // Note how we are specifying that Developer will inherit from Person\n  var favoriteLanguage: String\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage\n    super.init(name: name)\n  }\n  override func speak() {\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n}\nvar myDeveloper: Developer = Developer(name: \"Jay\", favoriteLanguage: \"Swift\")\nmyDeveloper.speak()\n```\n\nWow, that's a lot of new code! Let's go over it in sections.\n\n### Subclassing\n\nSubclassing refers to creating a new class that is based on another class. This allows our new class to inherit all of the characteristics of the parent class. In our example above we specify that Developer is a subclass of Person in the class definition itself.\n\n```swift\nclass Developer: Person {         // Here we specify that Person is the \"Superclass\"\n  // Developer definition here\n}\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\nWhen we create a subclass, it automatically gains access to the super's init method. But what if we want to add logic to the initialization of just the subclass? In our Developer example, we want to also specify a favoriteLanguage property in the subclass' initialization. We do not want the Person class to have a favoriteLanguage so we declare the property in the Developer class and create another init method.\n\n```swift\n  var favoriteLanguage: String       // Declaring the favoriteLanguage property in Developer means that\n                                     // it is only available in Developer and Developer's subclasses.\n  init(name: String, favoriteLanguage: String) {           // Developer's init method takes in\n                                                           // a name and a favoriteLanguage.\n    self.favoriteLanguage = favoriteLanguage               // We set the favoriteLanguage property.\n                                     // We then call the superclass' init method and pass it the name\n    super.init(name: name)           // property since the logic is already written in Person's init.\n  }\n```\n\nThe main thing to remember when creating an init method in a subclass is the use of\n\n<pre> super.init\n```\n\nwhich allows us to call upon the superclass' initialization method.\n\n### Overriding Superclass Methods\n\nBy default, a subclass has access to all of the superclass' methods and properties. However, what if we wanted to override a particular method's functionality. Fortunately Swift allows us to prefix a method name with the override keyword to specify that we will be overriding the default superclass functionality. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n  override func speak() {                    // We specify that we are overriding the speak function.\n    print(\"Hello! I am a Developer! My name is \\(self.name)\")  \n  }\n```\n\nNow when we called speak on an instance of Developer it will run the Developer's speak function rather than the superclass speak function."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/inheritance"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Swift is what we call a **statically typed language** what this means is that we need to specifically declare the \"type\" of each of our variables. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\n// Variables are used to store data. We declare a variable using the \"var\" keyword.\n// We also have to specify the type of that variable.\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\n// Every variable declaration follows the same format:\n// var variable_name: variable_type = variable_value\n```\n\nAlthough this may seem unnecessary, strongly typed languages allow the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough memory to store the specific data type. Internally, computers store variables in blocks of memory that are just 1s and 0s. Specifying the type allows the computer to understand not only how much actual space to allocate but also how to interpret the 1s and 0s that are stored!\n\nA strongly typed language not only forces you to **declare the type** but, more importantly, disallows you from **changing the type** this means that once a variable is declared as a \"String\" type it must always store a String. Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Anakin\"\nname = \"Darth Vader\"  // Changing the \"name\" variable to another string is allowed...\n                      // ...but trying to change the var to a value of ANOTHER type is not allowed.\nname = 42             // THIS WON'T WORK because we are trying to change a variable that is a \"String\"\n                      // type to a value that is a \"Int\" type\n```\n\n**This means that once we declare a variable we can only hold one specific type of data inside of it!**\n\n### Basic Types\n\n```swift\nvar str: String = \"This is a String\"   // \"String\" type.\nvar num: Int = -42                     // \"Int\" type stores whole numbers both negative and positive.\nvar dec: Double = 4.2                  // \"Double\" type stores numbers with decimals (allocates 64 bits).\n```\n\n### Why is Swift Statically Typed?\n\n**Performance**.\n\nMany other languages like Ruby and Javascript are **dynamically typed languages** meaning that we don't need to specifically declare the type and we can change what is stored in a variable back and forth between different types. Although loosely typed languages may be easier for the developer (since the developer doesn't need to worry about types), it reduces performance because now the computer has to worry about remembering types and how to store different values of different types. In addition, the computer now has to allocate extra space for each variable and it has to store them in such a way that the variable can hold any type of information. **Swift is statically typed** so it forces the developer to be more conscious about types and it also allows the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough space for each variable.\n\n# Type Inference\n\nConstantly having to specify the type can get tedious very quickly. Fortunately in addition to caring about performance, Swift also caters to the developer! Swift uses \"type inference\" to allow us to forego specifying the type when declaring a variable and assigning it to a value in the same line. Swift will look at the value and \"infer\" the type so that you don't have to specify it.\n\n```swift\n// Swift has \"type inference\"\nvar name = \"Anakin\"  // String type\n                     // Swift looked at val on the right and inferred type: we didn't have to specify!\n```\n\n#### Even though we didn't have to specify the type, the variable still has a type that cannot change after a declaration.\n\n```swift\nvar name = \"Anakin\"            // Type inferred as String based on the value \"Anakin\"\nname = 42                      // THIS IS STILL NOT ALLOWED since name is a \"String\" type\n```\n\n**Take a minute and try out the above code in a playground and see what the error message is.**\n\n# Constants\n\n**Variables hold data that varies**. In many programming languages, variables are used for everything, even for values that never change. **Constants hold data that does not vary**. We cannot change constants. Constants are a big deal in Swift. **Use constants in all parts of your code except for areas where you HAVE to use a variable**. Using constants to hold data that won't change allows our code to be more explicit while at the same time helps the compiler to run our programs more effectively. \n\nWe declare constants using the \"let\" keyword:\n\n```swift\n                            // Declare name as a constant because we anticipate that it will NOT change.\nlet name: String = \"Anakin Skywalker\"\n                            // Note that just like variables, constants also have types\n                            // Now we cannot change the name:\nname = \"Darth Vader\"        // THIS WON'T WORK because name is a constant so we CANNOT change it.\n```\n\n## Mutable vs. Immutable\n\n**Mutable** means that we can change the value and** immutable** means that we cannot change the value. In Objective-C, there were _explicit Types_ that were indicated as Immutable. For example, there was a class for mutable_ String Types_ and a separate class for immutable _String Types_. In Swift, we can still have immutable and mutable Strings without having another class because of the difference between the_ let _and the _var_ keywords.\n\nWe use the keyword_ let _when we want to declare a constant. **Constants** are values that are not going to change during your program. We use the_ var _keyword when we want to hold onto a value that might change. Using these keywords we can create mutable strings and immutable strings.\n\n```swift\n                                // We are declaring a mutable string because we store it in a var.\nvar myMutableString = \"change me\"\n                                // We are declaring an immutable string because we store it in a const.\nlet myImmutableString = \"can't change\"\n                                // We can change the value of a mutable string...\nmyMutableString += \"!\"\n                                // ...but we cannot change the value of an immutable string.\nmyImmutableString += \"ahhhh\"    // This will error.\n```\n\nThis is the same for Arrays.\n\n```swift\n// We are declaring a mutable array because we are storing it in a variable.\nvar myMutableArray = [\"one\"]\n// We are declaring an immutable array because we are storing it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableArray = [\"uno\"]\n// We can append new String instances to the mutable array...\nmyMutableArray.append(\"two\")\n// ... in fact we can add new things to this mutable array as well...\nmyMutableArray + [\"three\", \"four\"]\n// ...but we will get an error when we try to do the same to an immutable array.\nmyImmutableArray.append(\"dos\")\n```\n\nAnd for dictionaries.\n\n```swift\n                          // We are declaring a mutable dictionary because we store it in a variable.\nvar myMutableDictionary = [\"one\": 1]\n                          // We are declaring an immutable dictionary because we store it in a constant.\nlet myImmutableDictionary = [\"uno\": 1]\n                          // We can add a new key-value pair to our mutable dictionary ...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"two\"] = 2\n                          // ... or update a value of an existing key...\nmyMutableDictionary[\"one\"] = 0\n                          // ... but we get an error when we try to do same to an immutable dictionary.\nmyImmutableDictionary[\"uno\"] = 2\n```"], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/let_and_var"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

If we want to execute a set of code repeatedly for a given number of iterations or until it reaches a specific condition, we will use loops. There are two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. We **use the for loop when we know beforehand how many times we are going to have to repeat the code** while we **use the while loop when we don't know how many times we have to run the code, but we know we have to run the code until it reaches a particular condition.** However, at their core, they are both the same, we can do whatever you can do with a for loop instead of a while loop and vice versa.\n\n## For-in Loops\n\nA **for-in loop performs a set of code in a specific range, sequence, or collection**. For now, we will focus on using the for-in loop with a range. Go ahead and run the following code below, in the playground, and see what the output is from the Assistant Editor.\n\n```swift\n// loop from 1 to 5 including 5\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from 1 to 5 excluding 5\nfor i in 1..<5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nYou can just as easily use variables to create a range as well!\n\n```swift\nvar start = 0\nvar end = 5\n// loop from start to end including end\nfor i in start...end {\n    print(i)\n}\n// loop from start to end excluding end\nfor i in start..<end {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\nNote that when writing for loops in Swift, you will always use the \"for-in\" style with a range. Although you can still use the C-style for loops with the separate initialization, condition, and increment clauses it has been deprecated in Swift 2.x and will be taken out altogether in Swift 3.\n\n## While Loops\n\nA **while loop is used to loop for an unknown number of times.** Unlike a For-in loop where you first specify a range to loop through, in a while loop, we simply specify a condition. Anything that we write with a for-in loop can be written with a while loop. Let's see how we can convert our for-in loops to while loops.\n\nWe can re-write this _**for-in**_ loop...\n\n```swift\nfor i in 1...5 {\n    print(i)\n}\n```\n\n... as a **_while_** loop.\n\n```swift\nvar i = 1\nwhile i < 6 {\n    print(i)\n    i = i+1\n}\n```\n\nNote that the while loop syntax requires us to create our own bounds. In later assignments, you may find situations where you don't know how many times you will need to repeat before entering the loop in these situations it is important to know how to use a while loop."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/loops"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

There is a minimum and maximum value that an instance of an _Int Type_ can represent. _Int Type_ is signed in Swift. What this means is that **it uses some of its possible representations to store negative numbers**. Let's see what the maximum value and minimum value of the Int Type is in Swift:\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int.min)\")\n```\n\nOn OS X (the desktop operating system) allocates 64 bits to store an _Int Type_. On iOS, this is different because some devices store _Int Types_ in 64 bits while older models such as the iPhone 5 utilize the 32-bit infrastructure. This seems like a big headache. Does that mean we have to write different code for different devices? **If we use the instances of the Int Type, the compiler will determine the appropriate size for an Int when it builds your program.**\n\n## Int32\n\nWe can have an Int be stored in 32 bits by creating an instance of _Int32 Type_. It is important to note that _Int_ and _Int32_ are different Types. _Int32_ is also signed. Let's see what the maximum and the minimum value of _Int32_ are.\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(Int32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(Int32.min)\")\n```\n\nThere's also similar Types available such as _Int8, Int16,_ and _Int64_. We only use these specific integer types when we are doing something like cryptography where the way integers are stored is important. We will also run across these types when we are interacting with libraries built when storing 32 bits for an integer was very common. **Most of the time you will simply use the _Int_ type**\n\n## UInt32\n\nWe also have the unsigned integer counterparts as well. Once again we should only be using these specific Integer type when the nature of our program forces us to. **We should use Int for all other cases and let the compiler decide how much memory to allocate when storing integers.**\n\n```swift\nprint(\"The maximum value \\(UInt32.max)\")\nprint(\"The minimum value \\(UInt32.min)\")\n```\n\n## Swift is Strongly Typed\n\n_Int, Int32, UInt32_ and all of the other variations of storing integers are all different types. What this means is that if we declare a constant or a variable to be of a specific Type, we can't assign a different type to it, even though they are just numbers.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k6zEyyo.png)\n\n**We want to use Int consistently throughout our code** so that we can leave the hard work to the compiler. We can convert other variations of the _Int Type_ by using this syntax:\n\n```swift\nvar myInt32: Int32 = 3\nvar myNormalInt: Int\n                     // This will not error, because we first convert Int32 to instance of Int Type\nmyNormalInt = Int(myInt32)\n```\n\n# Floating Point Numbers\n\n**There is a finite number of bits a computer has to represent: an infinite amount of numbers**. So how would a computer represent something like 1/3 which is .3333333 with 3's repeating until forever? A computer will try to do its best. The most important concept in this tab is the **while _Int's_ are precise, Floating Point Types are not**.\n\n## Double vs. Float\n\nSwift has two Types to represent numbers with decimals. The first is the **Double Type** which allocates 64 bits to represent a floating point number and the second is the **Float Type** which allocates 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Since a _Double Type_ **has more representations available** to it, it will **store the floating point number more precisely**. Rather than the _Int Type_ where the bits represented how many_ Int's_ it can represent, the extra bits for floating point numbers just represent its precision.\n\n## Double Is the Inferred Type\n\nIf we store a floating point number to a variable or a constant **Swift will automatically assume that it is a Double**. Just like how we want to use _Int's_ in our code as much as possible, we want to **use Doubles as much as possible so we can rely on Swift's type inference.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i0VTX7X.png) \n\n## Operations\n\nWe can perform basic operations in Swift such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\n```swift\nprint(\"Addition \\(1 + 3)\")\nprint(\"Subtraction \\(1 - 3)\")\nprint(\"Multiplication \\(1 * 3)\")\nprint(\"Division \\(1 / 3)\")\n```\n\nWhen we divide an instance of the _Int Type_ with another instance of the _Int Type_, we get another new instance of the _Int Type_. Then what will happen if we divide 1 with 3? We would expect the result to be something like .33333333.  **It results in zero because remember that Int's can only be whole numbers.** If there are decimal points then there is a different _Data Type_ for that. If we divide two _Int's_ together and its result should be represented in a decimal, Swift will just round the number down(even if it's 8.9999)."], ["path", "ios/fundamentals/numerical_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Let's see an example:\n\n```swift\nvar name: String = \"Jay\"  // This is a String type\nvar pet: String?          // This is an Optional String Type\n                          // Right now the val of pet is nil (we've not given it a val, so it has none).\npet = \"Skippy\"\n```\n\nWe know two things about an instance of an  _Optional Type_. **It either has a value or it has no value or nil**. For example, an empty string _\"\" is different from nil. There still is the value from \"\"_. **When it is nil it means there's nothing there.** _Optionals_ signal that an **instance may not have a value**. It warns developers that the value may **potentially be nil**. And **nil is very bad**. When we expect an instance to have a value and it doesn't, our application will crash. As iOS developers, we have to be very cautious of _nil _and **Optionals help us be better programmers and make Swift a safer language.**\n\n```swift\nvar xFactor: String?\n```\n\nHere we declared the variable  _xFactor_ to be of an **Optional Type that may contain an instance of a String Type**. We are declaring this as an _optional_ because_ xFactor_ might potentially be nil and we should not assume _xFactor_ to contain a value in our program. Let's store a value to this_ Optional Type_ and try to print it out. \n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3109/handouts/chapter3109_5324_iOS-Optionals.png)\n\nWe have to first unwrap the _Optional_ before we can use it. It's like a present. We first make sure that it isn't empty by shaking it around. If we hear something then we safely unwrap the present. \n\nDoing something like this is very common in Swift. If an _Optional Type_ is not_ nil _then do something. In fact, this is so common that there is a special syntax to make this process easier. This syntax is called **Optional Binding**.\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"\n// If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\" meaning there is something inside of present then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nif let unwrappedPresent = present {\n    print(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(unwrappedPresent)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Force Unwrapping\n\nIf we are 100% confident that the optional has a value and does not hold nil we can use shorthand syntax to unwrap the optional like so:\n\n```swift\nvar present: String? = \"Apple Watch\"        // If we can let \"unwrappedPresent\" equal \"present\"\n                                            // (meaning there is something inside of present)\n                                            // then go on to do something with \"unwrappedPresent\"\nprint(\"OMG THANK YOU FOR THE \\(present!)\")  // Force unwrap using the \"!\"\n```\n\nWe can force-unwrap optionals using the \"!\" operator. Note that this should only be done when we are absolutely sure that the optional holds a value (usually right after the optional has a value assigned to it).\n\n## Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals_ are a little weird. **They are still of the Optional Type**: it can either contain a value or it is nil. The difference is that **we don't need to unwrap them**. With great power comes great responsibility. If we try to access the value of an implicitly unwrapped optional, it will result in a runtime error if it does not have a value. \n\n```swift\nvar present: String! = \"Apple Watch\"         // We don't have to unwrap to use the value,\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\npresent = nil                                // but we can still set it to nil.\nprint(\"\\(present)\")\n```\n\nImplicitly unwrapped _optionals _are reserved for special cases.

Swift is a **compiled language**. What this means is that Xcode must first compile the entire program into 1s and 0s before it can execute the program. On the other hand, **Ruby and JavaScript are interpreted languages**. The difference is that compiled languages have to be translated completely before running while interpreted languages get translated on the fly as the program is getting read.\n\nInterpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. However, they are great for certain tasks where speed doesn't matter very much. For example, Interpreted languages are great for web applications because the bottleneck is almost never the language and if it is, it is probably because of poorly written code. On the other hand, native applications and games are often built in compiled languages because once they are compiled, it takes less time to execute than a program written with an interpreted language.\n\nCompiled languages are great but sometimes miss the immediate feedback you can get while playing around with Interpreted languages. This proposes a dilemma because playing around with code line by line is essential in learning a new language. However, this is hard to do with compiled languages. Xcode 6 fixed this issue with Swift with the introduction of Playgrounds. A playground does not require you to compile and run a complete project and evaluates Swift code on the fly like an interpreter for an interpreted language would.\n\nGo ahead and let's create our first Playground project. Click on **Get started with a playground** and create a file called _stringconcat_. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/f8DJfCE.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TwvPJCe.png)\n\nThe playground is split into two sections. On the left, there is the Swift code editor where we can write our code and on the right we have a sidebar that evaluates Swift code. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7ko9Qn6.gif)\n\n```swift\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\n```\n\nOn the first line, we have a comment. Comments will be ignored when programs are executed. They serve more as a reminder or notice for other developers. We can create a comment by prefixing our comment with '//' and the rest of the line will turn into a comment.\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n```\n\nThe import UIKit means that we are including all of the **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** made available to iOS and Mac developers by the **UIKit framework**. APIs are just **classes and functions written by someone** that we can use. We have to follow certain instructions depending on what API we are using to make our program run. **Utilizing Apple's APIs is a key component in becoming an effective developer**. We will be directed to Apple's documentation throughout the course so that we can practice learning new skills from reading the documentation. Spend no more than 10 minutes perusing through [UIKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/). \n\n```swift\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\"\n```\n\nWe declare a variable in swift with the keyword var. **A variable should only hold data that is going to change.** If the data is not going to change, we should not be using a variable. Inside the variable _'str_' we are going to assign the value _\"Hello, playground\"._ The quotations mean that we are creating an **instance of the String Type**. Strings are ordered **collections of characters**. We named our variable _str_ but we could have given it any other name.\n\n```swift\nstr += \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere we are adding two instances of the String Type together to create a new instance of String. This is a shorthand way (compound assignment operator) of adding instances of String Type this way:\n\n```swift\nstr = str + \" you are so cool\"\n```\n\nHere's a quick warning on creating instances of Strings. **Creating instances of String Type does not work with single quotes.**\n\n```swift\nvar errorStr = 'single quotes do not work' // don't use single quotes to create instances of String\n```\n\n## print\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2637/handouts/chapter2637_3609_print.gif)\n\nWe can print out our variables using a **print** function which is a function used to print a value to the console followed by a line break.

Generally, Structs are used more for creating collections of values. For example representing shapes is a great use for structs! Let's see this in action:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n}\nvar myRectangle = Rectangle()           // Taking advantage of type inference\nprint(\"\\(myRectangle.width)\")\n```\n\nHere we declare the Rectangle struct that has two stored properties: width and height that each has default values of 10 and 20 respectively. We instantiate the rectangle using the same syntax as with Classes.\n\n### Struct Methods\n\nMethods in Structs are very similar to methods in classes. Let's revisit our rectangle example.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width = 10\n  var height = 20\n  func printDesc() {\n    print(\"I have a width of \\(width) and a height of \\(height)\")\n  }\n  mutating func doubleWidth() {                // Why do we need the mutating keyword here?\n    width *= 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe implemented two methods in Rectangle. The first method, printDesc does not have to be prefixed **with the mutating keyword because the method is not changing the value of the instance in any way**. However, our second method, doubleWidth, **changes the value of one of its properties. Since the value is changing we have to prefix the method with the mutating keyword. **\n\n**Interestingly enough, we do NOT need the mutating keyword when writing a similar method in a Class. This has to do with _value types vs reference types_ which we will go over soon.**\n\n### **Struct Initialization**\n\nSimilar to Classes, with Structs, we need to initialize our properties when instantiating the class if they are not given default values. Fortunately, **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer so that we don't have to explicitly define the initialization method**. This **memberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. Let's see this in action.\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width = 200\n    var height = 400\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle()\n```\n\nIn the above implementation of the Rectangle Struct, we used the free \"empty\" initializer provided to us by the Swift compiler. We are given a  **f****ree \"empty\" initializer for our Types if we give all of our stored properties default values** **and do not define our own custom initializer.**\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int             // If we don't give default vals to vars, we have to use type annotation.\n    var height: Int\n}\n```\n\nIf we don't set the default values for all of the stored properties, then we will have to rely on the **\"memberwise\" initializer mentioned above.** **In this case, we don't have access to the free \"empty\" initializers anymore because we no longer can ensure that every property is going to have a value by the end of the initialization.**\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tm9xMnN.png)\n\nWait a minute...the error is saying that we are missing an external parameter name...but we never defined any. Here, because we didn't provide default values for our stored properties, and we didn't implement our own custom initializer,  **Swift will give us a \"memberwise\" initializer this time**.  To reiterate, the **m****emberwise initializer will include external parameter names for all of the stored properties that need values**. \n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n    var width: Int\n    var height: Int\n}\nlet rectangle = Rectangle(width: 200, height: 400)\n```\n\nIt is important to remember that the  **primary role of initialization is to make sure that the new instance has values for all of its stored properties**. If this is not possible, Swift will yell at us until we make the necessary changes to ensure that all stored properties will have a value at the end.\n\n### But wait... What's the real difference between Classes and Structs? Why do we have both?\n\nTo really understand why we have both Classes and Structs we must understand the difference between value and reference types.

But what does Value Type actually mean? \n\n**Value types are copied ** (if you change the value of the copy, you will not change the original) when they are **assigned to a variable or a constant** and **when they are passed in as an argument to a function**.\n\nOn the other hand, **Reference types** are not copied. Instead, their **memory address location **is passed back and forth so changing the value of a Reference Type will change all of the \"pointers\" (variables or arguments) that refer to that object. \n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n  var fullName: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.fullName = name\n  }\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi my name is \\(self.fullName)\")\n  }\n}\nvar j = Person(name: \"Ketul Patel\") // Initialize a Person object and assign it to the j variable\nvar k = j                           // Create a k variable and set its value to be the j variable\n                                    // (remember classes are reference types) \nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul Patel\"\nk.fullName = \"Ketul J Patel\"        // We are changing the name through the k variable.\nj.introduce()                       // Prints \"Hi my name is Ketul J Patel\" since both\n                                    // j and k refer to the same instance in memory\n```\n\nWhoa, that's a lot of confusing code! Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1.  We create the Person class that has a \"fullName\" property and an introduce method\n2.  We create an instance of Person and assign it to the \"j\" variable. This instance has the value \"Ketul Patel\" stored in the fullName property\n3.  We create another variable \"k\" and assign it to the \"j\" variable. Since classes are reference types instead of copying the instance in the \"j\" variable we simply point both \"k\" and \"j\" to the same instance in memory\n4.  Since k and j refer to the same instance, when we change the value by referencing the instance through the k variable it changes the value for j as well (one instance in memory referred to by 2 variables or \"pointers\")\n\n**In contrast, Structs are Value Types which means that when they are passed, their values are copied and then passed. **\n\nLet's take a look at an example of this:\n\n```swift\nstruct Rectangle {\n  var width: Int\n  var height: Int\n}\nvar square1 = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)\nvar square2 = square1                         // Here the val inside square 1 (an instance of Rectangle)\n                                              // is copied and passed rather than just pointed to.\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are the same because square2 is a copy of square1\nsquare2.width = 20                            // This only changes square2 because there are\n                                              // 2 separate instances of rectangle in memory\nsquare2.height = 20\nprint(\"square1's width: \\(square1.width), square2's width \\(square2.width)\") \n                                              // They are different now: changing square2 changed a\n                                              // completely separate instance from square1.\n```\n\nThe major difference between Structs and Classes is the Value vs Reference Types that we see in the examples above. Remember that we **pass types in 2 main ways -- pass to a variable and pass to a function**. \n\n**Every type in Swift that is not an instance of a class or function is a Value Type. This includes Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries which are implemented internally as Structs in Swift. **\n\nThe only way to pass a Value Type by memory location is by using the **inout** designation when passing the Value type as an argument to a function."], ["path", "ios/intro_to_osx/value_vs_reference_types"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

This means that this class will primarily focus on applications that are running on iOS such as iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch applications. Although we will be primarily focused on building iPhone applications, building for other devices is very similar. OS X is an operating system for MacBooks and Macs. Fortunately, building OS X applications is not that very different either.\n\n# What We Need to Know\n\n*   **Language**: The primary language that we will be using in this course will be Swift. Apple created Swift with the intention of replacing Objective-C. However, we will be examining some Objective-C code to explore _why_ Swift was developed as well as to get you more familiar with Objective-C in case you need to dive into libraries that are written in it.\n*   **Development environment**: Xcode. If we want to develop anything for Apple, it is going to happen inside of Xcode. One of the benefits of having an all-in-one tool for building applications is that we will be spending less time configuring our environment and more time building our applications.\n*   **Frameworks**: There are tons of frameworks. Each framework is basically a course in and of itself. We will be covering some of the frameworks but the goal by the end of the course is **having the ability to read the documentation and figure out how to use a framework of your choice**.\n*   **Patterns**: iOS programming might feel a little bit different at first with protocols, delegates, and blocks. It is important that we know these patterns and implement in our code so that we can collaborate with other developers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Solid understanding of the Swift Programming Language\n*   Latest version of Xcode"], ["path", "ios/ios_advanced/ios"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Afterward, we are going to apply Auto Layout again to our iOSQuiz application. **The best way to learn Auto Layout is to keep practicing**. Some people say Auto Layout is the **hardest part about iOS programming and it isn't uncommon to find yourselves spending hours laying out your application and end up deleting all of the constraints and starting over.** You will find plenty of developer frustration over Auto Layout on the Web and it is because **it really pushes developers to think about design differently**. Auto Layout has gotten better over the years and it is a crucial skill for us to master if we want to create one layout that will work across devices and orientations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831211\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nGo to  [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AutoLayoutConcepts/AutoLayoutConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH14-SW1) and read the Introduction, Auto Layout Concepts, and Working with Constraints in Interface Builder. **At first, it may seem like Auto Layout is slowing you down**. It takes time thinking about design in this way. We set specific constraints in our View objects in our storyboard **so that they would know how to adapt depending on screen size and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).** Auto Layout is more important now as Apple has moved on to creating products in all shapes and sizes.\n\nImagine the world without Auto Layout. We would have to create a different layout for all devices and a different one for each orientation. Can you imagine creating a different layout every time a new Apple product is released? **As developers, we need to accept the uncertainty of the various future products Apple will introduce and make sure that the applications that we make can adapt to these new environments**. We set constraints on our View objects so that they know how to adapt to its environment.\n\nWhen we ran our current application, it does not look at all like how we laid it out in the storyboard. And why is our scene so square?! Apple wants us to think about design differently; instead of placing things based on fixed screen width, we create rules for our view objects to adapt to any given scenario. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/TMMrY8s.png)\n\nThere are 4 tools available to use in Auto Layout\n\n*   Align popover\n*   Pin popover\n*   Resolve menu\n*   Resizing Behavior menu\n\n## Step 1 [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/caHj95B.gif)\n\nWe will be setting constraints on our question label first. **Constraints can either be set between two different View Objects or onto itself**. Our goal is to set just enough constraints so that Xcode will know how to layout our application no matter the screen size or orientation. If we add too much or too little, Xcode will complain to us. **We are going to set the first constraint onto the question label itself**. We are going to give Horizontal Center in Container constraint to our question label by first clicking on the label, adding the constraint in our **Align popover** menu.\n\nAfter we place this constraint, Xcode will complain to us by giving us orange lines. **This is Xcode telling us that our layout is ambiguous: there's more than one possible layout given the constraints**. This is because Xcode can place the question label anywhere as long as it is horizontally centered. We are going to set three more constraints. We are going to \"pin\" the question label to the top, left, and right using the third icon with a measurement of 0 in our **Pin popover** menu. **In the Auto Layout video, we did these steps by control dragging from one object to the object we wanted to create a constraint with. This is just an alternate way and some developers prefer just using the Pin popover menu because it is less error prone when our layout is very complicated.**  Since we have \"Constrain to margin\" selected, question label will go as close as the recommended margin. Then we will set our Lines attribute of our question label to 0 so that the label can move on to the next line if the question is long. **If you are getting warnings regarding frames, click on Resolve menu and click update frames. What the warning is telling you is that given the current constraints, the View Objects might not be placed where you might expect.**\n\n## Step 2: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9zVPB.gif)\n\nNow let's add constraints to our buttons. First, we want to pin the Answer button with a left value of 0 and top value of Standard Value in our **Pin popover** menu. **Standard Value is the same as 8, but try using Standard Value as much as possible**. **It is important to note that the constraint to the left is different from the constraint to the top in this example.** The first constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the super view**. We want the Answer button to be 0 points away from the super view that is the parent view of all subviews. On the other hand, the second constraint is a **relationship between the Answer button and the question label**. We want to be Standard Value away. We can observe and even choose which View objects we want to have a relationship in the same drop-down menu in the Pin Popover.\n\n## Step 3: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/lYwbe3i.gif)\n\nNext, we need to make sure our Next button is laid out properly. We are going to do this by creating a relationship between Answer button and Next button by giving them a baseline constraint in our **Align popover** menu. This means that their baselines will always match up. Now we could pin the Next button to the top and to the right, but we only have to pin it to the right in this case. This is because since the Answer button is already pinned to the top, and has to have matching baselines with Next, Xcode has enough information to place the Next button.\n\n## Step 4: [gif-walkthrough](http://i.imgur.com/TAWlhu1.gif)\n\nNow we just have to place the answer label properly. We are going to give 2 constraints to itself by giving it the Horizontal and Vertical Center to Container. This is creating a relationship between the answer label and the super view. Then we are going to pin the left and the right with a value of 0\\. Now Xcode has enough information to layout our UI.\n\n## Strategies\n\n**Pick one of the top corners and work towards the opposite corner. **Add constraints to the top left most view and move to the bottom right. If we jump around we are bound to overlook something. **Auto Layout is a delicate process and there will be many times where it might just be easier to start all over.**\n\nWe can either run and build your app each time but it is more convenient to have a preview pane open so that you can see our changes in real time. Try to avoid reset to suggested constraints.\n\nAfter we have set all of the constraints open up the size inspector to for each View object and see if you can find any numbers that are not 0 or a Standard Value. Try to use these as much as possible.  If we are doing something other than the standard we should think very carefully if that is really needed."], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/auto_layout"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

You can think of stacks as similar to divs in HTML that act as containers. We will be remaking the previous assignment of TicTacToe with stack views. Using Stack Views make building interfaces much easier in iOS so let's get started with them!\n\n**_**Keep in mind stack views are not a complete replacement for auto-layout, but rather an additional tool to make the auto-layout process easier**_**\n\n## Step 1:\n\nSimilar to HTML/CSS divs layouts we want to start by laying out the major areas of our app that will be contained in stacks first then proceed to add elements inside of them. Start by adding 4 major vertical stack sections for the top label, middle section to hold our gameboard buttons and two more for our hidden winner label and the reset button.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5898_1.png)\n\n## Step 2:\n\nFrom here we want to add some basic constraints to these 4 stacks. For all of the stack views, we want to add leading, trailing, top, and bottom constraints. We also want to be sure to add height values to **ALL** **BUT** the middle stack. The middle stack does not get a set height constraint due to it being the one that we want to have dynamically changed as the size of the screen and orientation shift.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nWe can add text and buttons to the other stacks on the page as needed now. You will notice that these elements will auto size to the size of the stack they are placed in. The text for the buttons will be centered automatically, but for text in labels to be centered you just need to change the text alignment.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5899_2.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nOnce this is done we want to change the distribution of our middle stack that will hold our gameboard buttons to \"Fill Equally\" so that anything added to it will take up equal percentages of the stack they are contained in. If the distribution is left to \"Fill\" all elements will full size to the container, overlapping each other instead of trying to share the container space.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5900_3.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nThe next thing to do is to add three horizontal stacks that will be inside this middle vertical stack. This is done to represent the rows for the buttons. This system of embedding horizontal stacks in a vertical one or vice versa makes for an easy way of defining a grid system. **Remember these newly added stacks will be needed to be set to a Fill Equally distribution as well just like their parent.**\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5901_4.png)\n\n## Step 6:\n\nWe can now add our buttons to each row simply by dragging them into their respective rows (the horizontal stacks). Easy enough! With that, you can add some styling and background effects to the buttons as desired.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5902_5.png)\n\n**With that, we have fully laid out our TicTacToe App that will work for any orientation.** The only additional thing is currently the buttons are completely touching so if we wanted to add something similar to the padding or margin properties typically found in CSS to the stack we just have to edit the \"spacing\" of these stacks. This can be done by clicking each stack and changing its spacing property found on the right-side editor.\n\n![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3639/handouts/chapter3639_5903_6.png)"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/stack_views"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Currently, the standard editor is selected and it gives you a single pane dedicated to editing a file. **The Venn-diagram button next to the standard editor button splits the editor into two panes and Xcode will try to display two relevant files to you**. If you don't like what XCode gives you, **you can always control which files to display on either screen with the Jump Bar (explained later in the tab)**. You can also select the version editor which is useful when we want to compare different versions of your app when we use source control. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ICaJrll.gif)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator is the left-hand side of your XCode. Here we can seamlessly navigate through different aspects of our application. Here are the 8 Navigators available in the Navigator section. We can either click on the icons or we can use Command + 1 to access the Project Navigator (the first one), Command + 2 to access the Symbol Navigator, and so on.\n\n*   **Project Navigator**: List of files that are used in our project.\n*   **Symbol  Navigator**: Symbols are items that the compiler recognizes such as classes, enumerations, and structs.\n*   **Find Navigator**: We can find and replace any part of your application from one search bar.\n*   **Issue Navigator**: Whenever our application fails to build and run we can check out the errors or warnings here.\n*   **Test Navigator**: We can run our unit tests here.\n*   **Debug Navigator**: This is where we will go to debug our application. There are tools that keep track of memory, CPU, and the stack frame. A stack frame is a list of functions that have been called, in the order they were called. If you click on any aspect of the stack frame, we can observe the environment of our application right after that function was called.\n*   **Breakpoint Navigator**: We can make breakpoints in any part of our code so that we can look at the values in variables during that specific time in the life cycle. This is where we can look at all of our breakpoints from one place.\n*   **Log Navigator**: The Log Navigator keeps a history of recent build results and runs logs.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yxr75j6.gif)\n\n## Jump Bar\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QiK0neQ.png)\n\n1.  We can access our recent files here, as well as the list of counterparts, superclasses, subclasses, and more.\n2.  The back arrow goes back one file and forward arrow undoes a back arrow. They work in the same way as our browsers.\n3.  This part of the jump bar allows us to navigate files without using the navigator. This area has a segmented pop-up that displays the hierarchical path to reach the selected file in the project. We can click on different parts of the segmented pop-up and XCode will navigate us there.\n\n## Utility Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/HkmuS9H.png)\n\n1.  The upper part of the Utility Area is a **context sensitive panel** which will give you a more detailed information of whatever is being displayed in the editor pane. You can also make changes here depending on what you have selected. For example, if you have a button selected in the editor area, you will be able to change some of its attributes such as size, text, background color in this panel. When a file such as _ViewController.swift_ (we have this clicked in the picture to the left) is in the editor pane, the inspector selector bar will have two different icons, one that looks like a paper, and one with a question mark on it. The paper icon specifies the File inspector where we can view and manage metadata for a file such as its name, type, and path. The question icon specifies Quick Help which gives us details about a symbol. **This is a great place to learn more about specific API classes that we are unsure of.** When we select objects in the Interface Builder, we are given additional selectors. We will go over these more thoroughly later in the chapter.\n2.  The lower part of the Utility Area is where we can **drag and drop different kinds of resources to our project**. One of the primary usages of this part of the Utility Area is the Object Library which is what is selected in the picture to the right. This is where we can drag and drop UI elements onto our Storyboard (discussed later). Things that can be dragged and dropped from this area are File templates, Code snippets, Objects, and Media files.  \n\n## Editor Area\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/SxWzDPT.png)\n\n**We will either be working with Swift code or the Interface Builder in the Editor Area**. This is where most of our work will be done. We can also display different editors by choosing different editors in the Toolbar mentioned above. We will be going over the Interface Builder more in depth in the next tab as we build out the UI of our application.\n\n## Debug Area\n\n<div>\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/xH9ld2t.png)\n\nThe left side of the Debug Area is where we can closely observe values in specific variables during a breakpoint in our application. The right side of the Debug Area is where we can see any of our logs that we put in our application. **We log during different parts of the application so that we know that something is hooked up properly or not.**\n\n</div>"], ["path", "ios/ios_basics/xcode"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Apple describes a Storyboard as **\"a visual representation of the user interface for an iOS application\".** The beauty of the Storyboard is it allows us to create a robust UI without having to dive into coding. This encourages the tried and true practice of building the UI first before hooking it up to code.\n\nWe will first create a book regarding our passion for iOS using multiple Scenes (screens). This will help us practice transitioning from screen to screen.  **We will then create a new project that does exactly what we did with multiple scenes with just one scene.** **Transitioning between scenes is easy to do but should not be abused. We need to think ****carefully whether**** something deserves its own scene or is part of the current one.** We will use only a single scene in this chapter. **A single scene is very powerful.**\n\n## View Controller + Views\n\nA scene corresponds to a single View Controller and its views. As we will see as we move through the course, every scene has its own View Controller that uses the scene to display many Views to the user. **The Scene defines the layout and placement of different \"Views\" or components on the page while the View Controller manages the Scene as well as all the states of the different Views (components) that make up that Scene.** This will become more and more apparent as we move through the chapter.\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.1\n\nLet's put our iOSQuiz application on hold for now and start on a new application to illustrate how we go from scene to scene. **We will first go over concepts that we haven't covered yet, to illustrate the role of storyboards (go from one scene to another and see the flow from a high level). We will build an application like this one for an assignment, so this isn't our only opportunity to practice things such as IBOutlet and IBAction. Just focus on the high-level concepts for this tab.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142831600\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"2\"></iframe>\n\n## I Want To Play My Storyboards v.2\n\n**Just because we can use many scenes doesn't mean we should overuse and abuse them.** It is important to use View Controllers to add logic to a scene and thereby make it more powerful. Let's see this in action with the next video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832099\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"3\"></iframe>\n\n## Gotcha\n\n**We have to be careful when removing IBOutlets and IBActions**. Deleting them from our code doesn't ensure that the connection no longer exists. If we get a strange error saying that connections we deleted still exist, click on the ViewController and go to the Connections Inspector to check whether all connections are correctly hooked up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/142832760\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" kwframeid=\"4\"></iframe>\n\n## Connections\n\n**A View Controller's job is to manage a single screen from your app**. **We let a View Controller control our screen by making connections between our UI elements in the Storyboard by control-dragging them into the View Controller code.**\n\n**A connection lets one object know where another object is in memory so that the two objects can communicate. **\n\n*   An **Outlet** points to, or references, an object\n*   An** Action** is a method that gets triggered by a button or some other view that the user interacts with\n\n**An Outlet connects a property in code to a View object in a storyboard. This lets us read and write to the object's properties** like reading a value of a button, or a slider, or the contents of a text field. **An Action connects an event generated by user interaction with a storyboard to a method in our code.** This lets us respond to specific events triggered by objects in our storyboard. You might wonder why we have to specify IBOutlet and IBAction in our code. This syntax is not part of Swift. We put it there so Xcode can figure out to put the little dot there and make it connect to the UI in the storyboard.

Always design how you want the UI to look and then figure out how to make it work with the code.** XCode is perfectly made for this workflow. **We can build our UI by dragging and dropping things such as Labels and Buttons from our Object library**. The reason why we build the UI first is that after we build the UI **we will be able to have a better understanding of our application and, therefore, waste less time figuring out how to make it work.**\n\n## Building our Interface\n\nClick on Main.storyboard and place a Label in the center-top of the square view. Double click on the Label and replace the text inside with \"What is the first step to iOS development?\" You might be wondering why we lay out our UI on a square screen. There are no devices (except for Apple Watch) that have square screens. The Apple Watch is a perfect example why we can no longer think about designing our UI for a specific screen size. **We don't know what kind of products Apple will release, and we already have multitudes of Apple products with varying screen sizes. By designing our UI in a square canvas helps us think about layout in terms of constraints rather than exact placement.** We will be placing constraints using Auto Layout in the next tab.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/AOth9XP.gif)\n\n**When we are initially placing View objects into the Storyboard, try to use the guided blue lines as much as possible. This is XCode helping us make better UI.** Next, we are going to drag two buttons out of the Object Library. We can drag and drop the buttons just like we did with the label. One button will be to the left with the text \"Answer\" and the other button will be to the right with the text \"Next.\" \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MIkGJVw.gif)\n\nNow we are going to drag and drop another Label in the center of the screen with the following text: \"Create the user interface. As we create the UI, we will get a better understanding of our application. Then we breathe life into our application.\" With default settings, our Label will go off the screen as it tries to fit all of the text in one line. First, we will have to click on the Label and then go to the Utility Area, select the Attributes Inspector and change the number of lines to be 0\\. Once it is set to 0, XCode will wrap the text around once it hits the width of the containing label. We can also set the text here instead of double clicking on the label. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/a9geJ24.gif)\n\nWe are done with building our UI! Kind of. Go ahead and press Command + R to build and run your application. **The results might not be what you were expecting. To fix this, we have to add constraints with Auto Layout.**"], ["path", "ios/ios_intern/ui_first"], ["created_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 19:10:17 UTC]]

Setting up an Action is similar but it is **connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by interacting with one or more View objects**.\n\n## Actions\n\nNow let's set up Actions for our buttons. **Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button, we want to trigger some lines of code**. For example, when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label. We specify that the View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton. The default is AnyObject but that is too vague. **We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.** Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.\n\nHere, we specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better. We are saying that this action is going to get triggered by a UIButton. Once the method gets called, it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action. We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice to be more descriptive when we can.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fC1DskU.gif)\n\nNow we can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone touches up inside our different buttons. We will just log out that a particular button was pressed for now. We will be able to see the results of the log in our Debug Area of our Xcode.![](http://i.imgur.com/Ewl3vYu.gif)"], ["updated_at", 2017-01-24 22:29:11 UTC], ["id", 26]]
